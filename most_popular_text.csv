"‘Burning Down a Way of Life’: Wildfire Rips Through a Hispanic Bastion","LAS VEGAS, N.M. — As rushing flames neared the remote mountains where his family has lived for generations, Miguel Martinez knew he had to move fast and flee with only the clothes on his back. “I left behind 25 goats, 50 rabbits, 10 chickens and two dogs,” said Mr. Martinez, 71, who escaped his home in the village of El Oro this week for an evacuee shelter. “I have no idea if my house is standing or if my animals are alive. I need to prepare for the possibility everything was wiped out.” More than a dozen wildfires are raging this month across the Southwest, as fire season stretches earlier than ever into spring. But the country’s largest active blaze, a megafire that has ballooned across more than 165,000 acres in northern New Mexico, has evolved with such ferocity that it threatens a multigenerational culture that has endured for centuries. Like Mr. Martinez, many who have fled the megafire, known as the Calf Canyon/Hermits Peak fire, are descendants of Hispanic settlers who arrived in New Mexico long before the United States came into existence. They intermarried with Native Americans, honed ways to grow crops in parched lands and preserved an archaically influenced form of Spanish that can still be heard in the aisles of the local Walmart. Speaking in a mixture of Spanish and English, Mr. Martinez, a retired musician, said his ancestors had settled so long ago in the village of Mañuelitas, where he grew up in a home built by his forebears, that he was not exactly sure when they had arrived. His wife is from the Aragón family, which long ago made nearby El Oro its home, he said. “It was a little bit of a shock to move to El Oro, but I’m adapted now,” Mr. Martinez said, reflecting on how closely bloodlines remain tied to the land in these remote settlements surrounded by pine trees and trout-laden streams. “I just hope I have a village to go back to.” Shaped by challenges that range from conquering armies to long economic slumps, these far-flung Hispanic villages withstood one test after another. But the worst drought in at least 1,200 years, marked by intense and unwieldy fire activity, is something new. “These fires are burning down a way of life that’s lasted hundreds of years,” said Rob Martinez, New Mexico’s state historian and an Albuquerque native whose parents hailed from Mora and Chacon, two outposts in the fire zone. (He is not related to the retired musician from El Oro.) Las Vegas, N.M., a town of about 13,000 that has long served as a hub for the surrounding villages and ranches, has become the nerve center for the fight against the blaze. Crews raced to the fire lines this week as ash fell from a sky shifting at times from bright blue to a surreal orange hue. As the fire continues to spread, it already ranks as the second largest on record in New Mexico, eclipsing the acreage lost to fires in the entire state in 2021. While no lives have been lost, the fire has destroyed at least 172 homes, forced many families to evacuate and remains just 20 percent contained. As dry weather persists, authorities warn that the fire could expand in various directions in the coming days. Updated       At least six other wildfires are currently scorching other parts of New Mexico, according to the National Interagency Fire Center, and this week President Biden approved a disaster declaration for five counties. The state’s blazes include the Cooks Peak fire, which has grown to 59,000 acres in Mora County, and the Cerro Pelado fire, a 29,000-acre blaze within 5.5 miles of Los Alamos National Laboratory, which helps to design and maintain the country’s nuclear weapons stockpile. As flames from the Calf Canyon/Hermits Peak fire could be seen on ridges from Las Vegas in recent days, officials evacuated the nearby United World College, a boarding school founded by the industrialist Armand Hammer, and emptied out the county jail, releasing some inmates and transferring others. Some who were forced to flee gathered in a shelter in an old middle school. Others slept in their vehicles or decamped to the homes of relatives or friends; some who had already evacuated to Las Vegas had to evacuate again when smoke filled the skies above the town. Diana Trujillo, 63, was raised in a three-room adobe home with her seven siblings in Monte Aplanado, near Mora. She said the ancestral structure survived the fire, but the double-wide trailer next door, where she had lived with her daughter and granddaughter, burned to the ground. “It’s a loss I can’t even put into words,” said Ms. Trujillo, the assistant manager of a senior center. “The beautiful mountain around us, all those trees, it’s all charcoaled now.” Paula Garcia fled Mora, with a population of about 800, first for Las Vegas and then Santa Fe. She said she had helped her 82-year-old father pack up his tools before escaping herself as the fire approached their tight-knit community. “It’s a place where people call each other primos and parientes” — cousins and relatives — Ms. Garcia, 50, said. Some of her ancestors put down stakes in the area in the 1860s, moving from other parts of northern New Mexico. Ms. Garcia, the executive director of the New Mexico Acequia Association, a nonprofit that works to protect the state’s 700 or so acequias, or irrigation ditches, said she attributed her community’s persistence to “pure grit.” “We’ve lived there so long because of our querencia,” said Ms. Garcia, a term she defined as “a cultural longing, a pull, that keeps us there.” Such ties to the land have origins in Spain’s colonization of New Mexico, which began in 1598, years before the English first settled in the Virginia colony of Jamestown. The colonists and their descendants persisted in relative isolation on the Spanish Empire’s northern fringe. New Mexico remains the nation’s most heavily Hispanic state, with nearly 48 percent of the population claiming Hispanic or Latino heritage. The small towns, villages and ranching outposts in the counties hit by the fire, where Hispanics account for about 80 percent of the population, still defy easy classification. So many families had previously left the area, largely for economic reasons, that they view it as a kind of homeland, or old country. In contrast to other rural areas around the United States that have leaned heavily Republican in recent elections, Mr. Biden carried San Miguel County, whose seat is Las Vegas, with 68 percent of the vote. Until the fire arrived in late April, one of the main sources of tension in Las Vegas was a recent dispute over a proposed museum exhibition about 19th-century Hispanic vigilante nightriders who had targeted Anglo land squatters after the United States took control of New Mexico. Relations between ethnic groups have evolved since then. But unlike other parts of the United States where Hispanics are viewed as newcomers and Anglos seek to defend their culture from demographic shifts, in northern New Mexico the roles are often reversed. “We bought our land back in 1993, but we’re still considered outsiders compared to many of our neighbors,” said Sonya Berg, 79, a retired teacher from Texas whose home in Rociada, a town of several hundred people, was destroyed by the fire. Still, Ms. Berg said she understood why some families remained in the area for generations, explaining that their land had been so important to her husband, who died in 2019, that his gravesite is on their fire-scorched property. “I’m sure we’ll rebuild,” she said. Given the fire’s erratic behavior, it is not clear when evacuees will be allowed back. Wendy Mason, a New Mexico wildfire prevention official, said it was the first time, at least in recent memory, that so many large fires were raging at once in the state. Ms. Mason also cautioned that more fires could start in the coming weeks. “We usually don’t expect much moisture until the monsoons arrive, and that’s generally not until July or August,” Ms. Mason said. Even if some rain falls, as it did in parts of the state over the weekend, it could be accompanied by lightning strikes that ignite other blazes, she warned. “Our climate is changing, making the fire season a lot longer and more intense,” Ms. Mason said. Still, Mr. Martinez, the state historian, emphasized that such challenges were part of the region’s history. Mora was burned to the ground, he noted, by invading American forces in 1847 during the Mexican-American War. After that episode, the community picked up the pieces and started again. “This isn’t the first fire our families have dealt with,” he said.","las vegas rushing flames neared remote mountains family lived generations miguel martinez move fast flee clothes left goats rabbits chickens dogs martinez escaped home village el oro week evacuee shelter idea house standing animals alive prepare possibility wiped dozen wildfires raging month southwest fire season stretches earlier spring country largest active blaze megafire ballooned acres northern mexico evolved ferocity threatens multigenerational culture endured centuries martinez fled megafire calf canyon hermits peak fire descendants hispanic settlers arrived mexico united existence intermarried native americans honed grow crops parched lands preserved archaically influenced form spanish heard aisles local walmart speaking mixture spanish english martinez retired musician ancestors settled ago village mañuelitas grew home built forebears arrived wife aragón family ago nearby el oro home bit shock move el oro adapted martinez reflecting closely bloodlines remain tied land remote settlements surrounded pine trees trout laden streams hope village shaped challenges range conquering armies economic slumps flung hispanic villages withstood test worst drought marked intense unwieldy fire activity fires burning life lasted hundreds rob martinez mexico historian albuquerque native parents hailed mora chacon outposts fire zone related retired musician el oro las vegas town served hub surrounding villages ranches nerve center fight blaze crews raced fire lines week ash fell sky shifting times bright blue surreal orange hue fire continues spread ranks largest record mexico eclipsing acreage lost fires entire lives lost fire destroyed homes forced families evacuate remains percent contained dry weather persists authorities warn fire expand directions coming days updated wildfires scorching mexico national interagency fire center week president biden approved disaster declaration counties blazes include cooks peak fire grown acres mora county cerro pelado fire acre blaze miles los alamos national laboratory helps design maintain country nuclear weapons stockpile flames calf canyon hermits peak fire ridges las vegas recent days officials evacuated nearby united world college boarding school founded industrialist armand hammer emptied county jail releasing inmates transferring forced flee gathered shelter middle school slept vehicles decamped homes relatives friends evacuated las vegas evacuate smoke filled skies town diana trujillo raised adobe home siblings monte aplanado mora ancestral structure survived fire double wide trailer door lived daughter granddaughter burned ground loss words ms trujillo assistant manager senior center beautiful mountain trees charcoaled paula garcia fled mora population las vegas santa fe helped father pack tools escaping fire approached tight knit community people call primos parientes cousins relatives ms garcia ancestors stakes moving northern mexico ms garcia executive director mexico acequia association nonprofit protect acequias irrigation ditches attributed community persistence pure grit ve lived querencia ms garcia term defined cultural longing pull ties land origins spain colonization mexico english settled virginia colony jamestown colonists descendants persisted relative isolation spanish empire northern fringe mexico remains nation heavily hispanic percent population claiming hispanic latino heritage towns villages ranching outposts counties hit fire hispanics account percent population defy easy classification families previously left economic reasons view homeland country contrast rural united leaned heavily republican recent elections biden carried san miguel county seat las vegas percent vote fire arrived late april main sources tension las vegas recent dispute proposed museum exhibition th century hispanic vigilante nightriders targeted anglo land squatters united control mexico relations ethnic evolved unlike united hispanics viewed newcomers anglos seek defend culture demographic shifts northern mexico roles reversed bought land considered outsiders compared neighbors sonya berg retired teacher texas home rociada town hundred people destroyed fire ms berg understood families remained generations explaining land husband died gravesite fire scorched property ll rebuild fire erratic behavior evacuees allowed wendy mason mexico wildfire prevention official time recent memory fires raging ms mason cautioned fires start coming weeks don expect moisture monsoons arrive july august ms mason rain falls weekend accompanied lightning strikes ignite blazes warned climate changing fire season lot intense ms mason martinez historian emphasized challenges region history mora burned ground noted invading american forces mexican american war episode community picked pieces started isn fire families dealt"
"Abortion Pills Stand to Become the Next Battleground in a Post-Roe America","If the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, the legal and culture wars over abortion that have consumed the United States for decades would increasingly shift to a new front: the use of abortion pills. Medication abortion — a two-drug combination that can be taken at home or in any location and is authorized for use in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy — has become more and more prevalent and now accounts for more than half of recent abortions in the United States. If the federal guarantee of abortion rights disappears, medication abortion would likely become an even more sought-after method for terminating a pregnancy — and the focus of battles between states that ban abortion and those that continue to allow it. “Given that most abortions are early and medication abortion is harder to trace and already kind of becoming the majority or preferred method, it’s going to be a big deal,” Mary Ziegler, a legal scholar who has written widely on abortion, said. “It’s going to generate a lot of forthcoming legal conflicts because it’s just going to be a way that state borders are going to become less relevant.” About half the states are expected to quickly make all methods of abortion illegal if the justices’ decision in a Mississippi case resembles a draft opinion leaked this week that would nullify the 1973 ruling that legalized abortion. In Louisiana, a legislative committee this week advanced a bill that would allow homicide charges to be brought against people who get abortions or perform them. Other states would likely continue to allow abortion, and several are already taking steps to accommodate patients from the states where abortion may be outlawed. Medication abortion is less expensive and less invasive than surgical abortions. In December, the Food and Drug Administration made access to it significantly easier by lifting the requirement that patients obtain the first of the two pills, mifepristone, by visiting an authorized clinic or doctor in person. Now, patients can have a consultation with a physician via video or phone or by filling out online forms, and then receive the pills by mail. But many conservative states have already begun passing laws to restrict medication abortion, including banning it earlier than 10 weeks’ gestation and requiring patients to visit providers in person despite F.D.A. rules. Nineteen states ban the use of telemedicine for abortion. This year, Americans United for Life, an anti-abortion advocacy group, listed laws against medication abortion as first among the organization’s “pressing priorities” for 2022. “In the last year, Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, Montana, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Texas have enacted state-level safeguards to stop mail-order abortion drugs, and the Tennessee Legislature recently sent such protections to Gov. Bill Lee,” Mallory Carroll, an official with Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group, said. “In addition to creating health and safety standards, states are also increasing requirements for reporting complications from abortion drugs. We will be working with allies in additional states to tackle this growing public health threat.” Residents of states that would quickly ban all abortion methods if Roe were overturned — including Texas, Missouri, Utah and Tennessee — would be legally prohibited from having telemedicine abortion consultations from any location in their state, even if the doctor were located in a state with legal abortion. Such patients would have to travel to a state where an online, video or phone consultation is legal — the IP address of the computer or phone they were using would identify where they were located. Then, they would have to receive the pills by mail at an address in a state with legal abortion, even if it were a post office box or a hotel. Some patients are already doing this because they live in one of the states that ban the use of telemedicine for abortion. Some aspects of those laws are unclear, including whether patients who take the pills after returning to their home state are violating their state’s law. If abortion were completely outlawed in those states, many more patients would travel to states where it was legal, reproductive health experts said. Several organizations, including Abortion on Demand and Hey Jane, now arrange telemedicine or online consultations and mail pills from one of two mail-order pharmacies that are currently authorized by the two mifepristone manufacturers to dispense that medication. But abortion opponents and states that outlaw abortion are likely to try to challenge or curtail the ability of patients to cross state lines to get the pills, legal experts said. There may be attempts by states that ban abortion to prosecute doctors and other health providers in states where abortion is legal, for example, or to try to block organizations or funds that provide financial help for patients to travel to other states, Professor Ziegler said. States that support abortion rights are mobilizing to block such efforts. Legislation in California would provide financial assistance to patients traveling from other states to obtain abortions and increase the number of abortion providers. Connecticut just passed a bill that would prevent abortion providers from being extradited to other states, bar Connecticut authorities from cooperating with abortion investigations from a patient’s home state and allow Connecticut residents who are sued under another state’s abortion provision to countersue. Medication abortion became legal in the United States in 2000, when mifepristone was approved by the F.D.A. The agency imposed tight restrictions on the drug, many of which remain in place. But access to the method increased in 2016, when the F.D.A. expanded the time frame within which the drug could be taken — from seven weeks to 10 weeks into a pregnancy. As conservative states began passing more laws restricting access to surgical abortions, more patients opted for pills, especially because they can be taken in the privacy of one’s home. The Covid pandemic fueled that trend. The Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights, reported that in 2020, medication abortion accounted for 54 percent of all abortions. Early in the pandemic, medical groups filed a lawsuit asking the F.D.A. to lift its requirement that mifepristone, which blocks a hormone crucial to the continuation of a pregnancy, be dispensed to patients in person at a clinic or doctor’s office. Citing years of data showing that medication abortion is safe, the medical groups said that patients faced a greater risk of being infected with the coronavirus if they had to visit clinics to obtain mifepristone. For portions of the pandemic, the F.D.A. temporarily lifted the in-person requirement, then permanently removed it in December. In addition, the agency said pharmacies could begin dispensing mifepristone if they met certain qualifications. The agency is in the process of hammering out those qualifications with the two manufacturers of the drug, and reproductive health organizations said that some national retail pharmacy chains have expressed interest in being able to dispense the medication in some states, at least by mail. The second medication, misoprostol, which causes contractions similar to those of a miscarriage and is taken up to 48 hours later, has long been available for a variety of uses with a typical prescription. What is Roe v. Wade? Roe v. Wade is a landmark Supreme court decision that legalized abortion across the United States. The 7-2 ruling was announced on Jan. 22, 1973. Justice Harry A. Blackmun, a modest Midwestern Republican and a defender of the right to abortion, wrote the majority opinion. What was the case about? The ruling struck down laws in many states that had barred abortion, declaring that they could not ban the procedure before the point at which a fetus can survive outside the womb. That point, known as fetal viability, was around 28 weeks when Roe was decided. Today, most experts estimate it to be about 23 or 24 weeks. What else did the case do? Roe v. Wade created a framework to govern abortion regulation based on the trimesters of pregnancy. In the first trimester, it allowed almost no regulations. In the second, it allowed regulations to protect women’s health. In the third, it allowed states to ban abortions so long as exceptions were made to protect the life and health of the mother. In 1992, the court tossed that framework, while affirming Roe’s essential holding. What would happen if Roe were overturned? Individual states would be able to decide whether and when abortions would be legal. The practice would likely be banned or restricted heavily in about half of them, but many would continue to allow it. Thirteen states have so-called trigger laws, which would immediately make abortion illegal if Roe were overturned. A senior Biden administration official said this week that officials are looking for further steps the administration can take to increase access to all types of abortion, including the pill method. The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the leaked Supreme Court decision, said that President Biden directed his team “at every aspect in every creative way, every aspect of federal law, to try to do all that’s possible” to protect abortion rights. As part of that effort, Mr. Biden’s secretary of health and human services, Xavier Becerra, said in testimony before the Senate on Wednesday that he has established a reproductive health care task force. But there are tight limits on what the administration can do without action from Congress. The longstanding Hyde Amendment, which prevents taxpayer dollars from being used to terminate pregnancy, bans the use of federal funds to pay for abortion, including through the Medicaid program, except in cases of rape, incest or life endangerment. Some experts have suggested that the government could direct resources to groups that provide support, including housing and transportation, to patients who cross state lines seeking an abortion. But it is possible that could violate the Hyde Amendment. Legal and reproductive rights policy experts said that beyond using his bully pulpit, Mr. Biden’s options are limited. They said the administration could turn to the courts and make a legal argument that doctors in the United States have a right to prescribe abortion medication from any state. “Because the F.D.A. has approved abortion pills as safe and effective and set forth a regimen by which they have to be dispensed, states are not allowed to do anything different, because federal law pre-empts or is supreme over state law,” said David Cohen, an expert in gender and constitutional law at Drexel University’s law school. But Lawrence Gostin, an expert in health law at Georgetown University, said there would also be a strong counterargument: that regulation of the medical profession is the province of states, which can therefore regulate what pharmacies prescribe. Reproductive health experts also predict that more patients will be ordering abortion pills from overseas, through websites like Aid Access — an international organization run by a physician that mails pills — a practice the F.D.A. has tried to stop. Professor Ziegler and others said it is hard for states or the federal government to stop or interdict the mailing of abortion pills because of the practical difficulties of tracking and identifying every such package. So far, most states that restrict abortion have long adhered to a principle of targeting providers and others who help patients, but not the patients themselves. Professor Ziegler said it is possible that could also change in a post-Roe landscape because, in circumstances where the abortion takes place outside state boundaries, “there may be absolutely no one else in that state to go after but the patient.” In the Louisiana legislature this week, a committee advanced a bill that would allow a patient who aborted a pregnancy, as well as anyone who assisted the patient, to be charged with murder. Opponents of the bill said that it was unconstitutional and could have far-reaching consequences, possibly even for practices like in vitro fertilization. Some abortion rights advocates said that the availability of safe and effective abortion pills has eliminated one of the greatest fears in the years before Roe — but has added a new one. “One of the sharpest distinctions is really between the idea of hemorrhaging and the idea of handcuffs,” said Kristin Ford, a spokeswoman for NARAL Pro-Choice America. “In the pre-Roe world, there was a legitimate concern about people bleeding out in back alleys. That’s not the reality we face. What we’re looking at now is a world of criminalization.” Zolan Kanno-Youngs contributed reporting.","supreme court overturns roe wade legal culture wars abortion consumed united decades increasingly

"Amber Heard Accuses ‘Belligerent’ Johnny Depp of Sexual Assault","Amber Heard described in graphic detail on Thursday how, she said, her ex-husband, Johnny Depp, beat and sexually assaulted her during a trip to Australia, during which she experienced the worst fear of her life. Ms. Heard, testifying in the defamation case filed against her by Mr. Depp, said the couple took the trip in 2015, shortly after they were married, because the actor was needed for the filming of the fifth “Pirates of the Caribbean” movie. But, while there, Mr. Depp took MDMA, became “belligerent” and attacked her, hitting her in the face, throwing her across the room, ripping off her nightgown and grabbing her by the neck, she said. “I’m looking in his eyes and I don’t see him anymore,” Ms. Heard, who sometimes broke into sobs during her testimony, said. “I’ve never been so scared in my life.” Ms. Heard described the encounter during her second day of testimony in Fairfax County Circuit Court, where she and Mr. Depp are locked in a tense legal battle over just who defamed whom. In his own testimony, Mr. Depp denied hitting Ms. Heard and denied sexually assaulting her, accusing her of being the aggressor in the relationship. The incident in Australia has emerged as a key point of contention in a trial that has focused on competing, and contradictory, accusations of spousal abuse. At some point during the confrontation Ms. Heard described, part of the middle finger on Mr. Depp’s right hand had been severed, but the couple has presented differing accounts of how it actually happened and who was to blame. Ms. Heard, 36, said Mr. Depp, 58, was angry about several issues, including his suspicion that she had been having an affair with another actor and his contention that she had been unkind to his sister. She said his attack escalated from vulgar name-calling to threats and violence. In an argument over his drinking, she said, she had thrown a liquor bottle on the ground. “That really set him off,” she said. Ms. Heard testified that during the fight, Mr. Depp threw bottles at her, missing, and that later he sexually assaulted her with a bottle. She said that, though she could not see the bottle at the time, she was later able to deduce what the object had been. According to Ms. Heard’s account, Mr. Depp severed his finger when he picked up a phone from the wall and smashed it into pieces. She said that after the attack she returned to that area of the house and found messages written on the walls and objects in the room, in blood and paint. During his testimony earlier in the trial, Mr. Depp said his finger had been severed when Ms. Heard threw a handle of vodka at him that had shattered on his hand. He said she had been upset about a meeting she had with a lawyer over a potential postnuptial agreement, and described her following him around the house, screaming obscenities and “hammering me with brutal words.” He testified that when she discovered him drinking, she hurled a bottle of vodka at him, which missed, and then another, which made contact. As his hand bled “like Vesuvius,” Mr. Depp testified, he experienced a “nervous breakdown” and used his bloody finger to write on the walls messages that “represented lies that she told me.” During her first day of testimony on Wednesday, Ms. Heard testified that Mr. Depp physically abused her throughout their relationship, recalling that his anger was triggered by suspicions she was being unfaithful, which would not abate despite her repeated denials. In his testimony, Mr. Depp had denied ever hitting Ms. Heard and accused her of being the person who resorted to violence by punching him, throwing objects at him and, once, kicking a bathroom door into his head. In court papers, Ms. Heard denied hitting Mr. Depp except in self-defense or in defense of her sister. In the courtroom. A defamation trial involving the formerly married actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard is currently underway in Fairfax County Circuit Court in Virginia. Here is what to know about the case: The case. Mr. Depp brought a defamation case against Ms. Heard in an effort to clear his name from domestic abuse allegations that she has made against him and that he denies. The jury is also considering a countersuit from Ms. Heard, who claims that Mr. Depp defamed her when his former lawyer said her domestic abuse claims were a “hoax.” Ms. Heard’s op-ed. Mr. Depp’s suit was filed in response to an op-ed Ms. Heard wrote for The Washington Post in 2018 in which she described herself as a “public figure representing domestic abuse.” Though she did not mention her former husband’s name, he and his lawyers have argued that she was clearly referring to their relationship. The end of their marriage. Ms. Heard filed for divorce in 2017, just over a year after the pair had married. She also obtained a temporary restraining order against the actor after accusing him of hitting her. She later withdrew that claim, and in January 2017, the couple agreed to a $7 million divorce settlement. An earlier defamation case. The trial follows another case Mr. Depp brought in London in 2020 against The Sun newspaper, which called him a “wife beater” in a headline. In that trial, a judge found that there was “overwhelming evidence” that he had assaulted Ms. Heard repeatedly during their marriage. The domestic abuse claims. In the 2020 trial, Ms. Heard accused her former husband of assaulting her first in 2013, after they began dating, and detailed other instances in which he slapped her, head-butted her and threw her to the ground. Mr. Depp has since accused her of punching him, kicking him and throwing objects at him. Mr. Depp’s suit contends that Ms. Heard defamed him in an op-ed piece in which she described herself as a “public figure representing domestic abuse.” Although the article did not name Mr. Depp, he has asserted that it clearly alluded to their relationship and resulted in significant damage to his acting career. Ms. Heard countersued Mr. Depp, asserting that he defamed her when a former lawyer of his made statements to the media claiming her domestic abuse allegations were a hoax. The seven-person jury is considering both lawsuits during the trial, which is taking place five years after the couple divorced. As Ms. Heard described it, Mr. Depp was a controlling presence in her life, intent on having a say over what she wore and what acting jobs she took. She testified that in 2014, he became angry about the fact that she had a romantic scene in a movie with the actor James Franco, leading to a confrontation on a private plane — one of the central incidents in dispute. On the plane, Ms. Heard said, Mr. Depp smelled of marijuana and alcohol, and he began asking her about the intimate scene with Mr. Franco, calling her a “go-getter” and suggesting that she had enjoyed it. She testified that she had tried not to engage but that Mr. Depp slapped her, threw ice cubes at her and then kicked her in the back. Eventually, she said, he locked himself in the bathroom and passed out. The incident led Ms. Heard to contemplate leaving him, she testified. “I was scared if I left him; I was scared if I didn’t,” she said. “I didn’t feel safe going home.” But Mr. Depp begged for forgiveness and promised that he was going to get sober, she said. “I got back with him on the condition that he would uphold his promise to do the treatment, to do the full detox,” Ms. Heard said. Mr. Depp gave a different version of events in his testimony. He denied having drunk excessively that day, saying he had taken two opioid pills and perhaps had a glass of champagne. Mr. Depp testified that Ms. Heard had been “actively searching for a way to instigate a fight with me” on the plane and was prodding him and heckling him, prompting him to retreat to the bathroom and fall asleep. He testified that Ms. Heard’s account of his drug and alcohol use was “grossly embellished.” There will be a break in the trial next week; Ms. Heard will resume her testimony on May 16.","amber heard graphic detail thursday husband johnny depp beat sexually assaulted trip australia experienced worst fear life ms heard testifying defamation filed depp couple trip shortly married actor filming pirates caribbean movie depp mdma belligerent attacked hitting throwing ripping nightgown grabbing neck eyes don anymore ms heard broke sobs testimony ve scared life ms heard encounter day testimony fairfax county circuit court depp locked tense legal battle defamed testimony depp denied hitting ms heard denied sexually assaulting accusing aggressor relationship incident australia emerged key contention trial focused competing contradictory accusations spousal abuse confrontation ms heard middle finger depp hand severed couple differing accounts happened blame ms heard depp angry issues including suspicion affair actor contention unkind sister attack escalated vulgar calling threats violence argument drinking thrown liquor bottle ground set ms heard testified fight depp threw bottles missing sexually assaulted bottle bottle time deduce object ms heard account depp severed finger picked phone wall smashed pieces attack returned house found messages written walls objects blood paint testimony earlier trial depp finger severed ms heard threw handle vodka shattered hand upset meeting lawyer potential postnuptial agreement house screaming obscenities hammering brutal words testified discovered drinking hurled bottle vodka missed contact hand bled vesuvius depp testified experienced nervous breakdown bloody finger write walls messages represented lies told day testimony wednesday ms heard testified depp physically abused relationship recalling anger triggered suspicions unfaithful abate repeated denials testimony depp denied hitting ms heard accused person resorted violence punching throwing objects kicking bathroom door head court papers ms heard denied hitting depp defense defense sister courtroom defamation trial involving married actors johnny depp amber heard underway fairfax county circuit court virginia depp brought defamation ms heard effort domestic abuse allegations denies jury countersuit ms heard claims depp defamed lawyer domestic abuse claims hoax ms heard op ed depp suit filed response op ed ms heard wrote washington post public figure representing domestic abuse mention husband lawyers argued referring relationship marriage ms heard filed divorce pair married obtained temporary restraining actor accusing hitting withdrew claim january couple agreed million divorce settlement earlier defamation trial depp brought london sun newspaper called wife beater headline trial judge found overwhelming evidence assaulted ms heard repeatedly marriage domestic abuse claims trial ms heard accused husband assaulting dating detailed instances slapped head butted threw ground depp accused punching kicking throwing objects depp suit contends ms heard defamed op ed piece public figure representing domestic abuse article depp asserted alluded relationship resulted significant damage acting career ms heard countersued depp asserting defamed lawyer statements media claiming domestic abuse allegations hoax person jury lawsuits trial taking couple divorced ms heard depp controlling presence life intent wore acting jobs testified angry romantic scene movie actor james franco leading confrontation private plane central incidents dispute plane ms heard depp smelled marijuana alcohol intimate scene franco calling getter suggesting enjoyed testified engage depp slapped threw ice cubes kicked eventually locked bathroom passed incident led ms heard contemplate leaving testified scared left scared didn didn feel safe home depp begged forgiveness promised sober condition uphold promise treatment detox ms heard depp version events testimony denied drunk excessively day opioid pills glass champagne depp testified ms heard actively searching instigate fight plane prodding heckling prompting retreat bathroom fall asleep testified ms heard account drug alcohol grossly embellished break trial week ms heard resume testimony"
"Amber Heard Testifies About a ‘Pattern’ of Violence by Johnny Depp","Amber Heard, an actress defending herself against a defamation lawsuit filed by her ex-husband, Johnny Depp, took the stand on Wednesday, recalling how a whirlwind romance that started on a movie set descended into a “pattern” of violence perpetrated against her by the actor. The couple first got to know each other in 2009 on the set of “The Rum Diary,” a movie that Mr. Depp produced and starred in, and they fell in love on the movie’s press tour, Ms. Heard testified. But by 2012, she said, Mr. Depp was repeatedly accusing her of infidelity and his anger would often escalate to physical attacks, despite her denials. “He would explode,” Ms. Heard said, recounting how Mr. Depp would punch walls next to her head, shove her to the ground and slap her repetitively. Ms. Heard often grew emotional during her testimony as she explained the physical confrontations in graphic terms, at times appearing chagrined as she gave reasons for staying in the relationship despite her misgivings. “He was the love of my life,” Ms. Heard said. “But he was also this other thing. And that other thing was awful.” In four days of testimony earlier in the trial at Fairfax County Circuit Court, Mr. Depp denied ever hitting Ms. Heard or any other woman. He accused her of being the aggressor in the relationship, describing instances in which he said she punched him and threw objects at him. But Ms. Heard has also denied ever hitting Mr. Depp, except in self-defense or in defense of her sister, and she provided a very different account of their relationship, which ended in divorce in 2017. In her account, it was Mr. Depp who would often erupt into fits of jealous rage, especially when he had been using drugs or alcohol. Once in 2013, Ms. Heard recalled, Mr. Depp accused her of an affair and then slapped her with the back of his hand, on which he wore rings. “I remember kind of just feeling like my lip went into my teeth,” she testified, “and it got a little blood on the wall.” The trial revolves around an op-ed from Ms. Heard, published by The Washington Post in 2018, in which she described herself as a “public figure representing domestic abuse.” Mr. Depp sued Ms. Heard over the op-ed, saying that even if the article did not name him, it was clearly alluding to their relationship, and that its publication had a devastating effect on his movie career. Ms. Heard, 36, countersued Mr. Depp, 58, alleging that he defamed her when his former lawyer released statements saying her allegations of abuse were a hoax. In the first three weeks of the trial, Mr. Depp’s lawyers called witnesses with the intention of proving that Ms. Heard’s domestic abuse claims were fictions that had severely damaged Mr. Depp’s career. They have also sought to prove that Ms. Heard was the primary abuser, playing audio of the couple discussing an incident in which Mr. Depp said Ms. Heard kicked a bathroom door into his head. Ms. Heard’s lawyers have argued that her statements in the op-ed are true, and that even if the jury determines it doesn’t have enough evidence to show Mr. Depp physically abused Ms. Heard, “domestic abuse” can include verbal and emotional abuse as well. “If Mr. Depp abused Ms. Heard physically, verbally, emotionally or psychologically, even one time, then she wins,” said Ben Rottenborn, a lawyer for Ms. Heard, in court on Monday. “It’s that simple.” But Ms. Heard testified that Mr. Depp abused her far more than once. The first time he hit her, she said, was about two years before they were married, when the actress laughed at one of his tattoos. He slapped her across the face three times, she said, a gesture so stunning that she initially responded with a laugh because she thought it must have been a joke. But when he objected to her laughing, she said she realized he had not been jesting and just stared at him silently. Soon Mr. Depp began crying, she said, and got down on his knees to tell her, “I thought I put the monster away.” In the courtroom. A defamation trial involving the formerly married actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard is currently underway in Fairfax County Circuit Court in Virginia. Here is what to know about the case: The case. Mr. Depp brought a defamation case against Ms. Heard in an effort to clear his name from domestic abuse allegations that she has made against him and that he denies. The jury is also considering a countersuit from Ms. Heard, who claims that Mr. Depp defamed her when his former lawyer said her domestic abuse claims were a “hoax.” Ms. Heard’s op-ed. Mr. Depp’s suit was filed in response to an op-ed Ms. Heard wrote for The Washington Post in 2018 in which she described herself as a “public figure representing domestic abuse.” Though she did not mention her former husband’s name, he and his lawyers have argued that she was clearly referring to their relationship. The end of their marriage. Ms. Heard filed for divorce in 2017, just over a year after the pair had married. She also obtained a temporary restraining order against the actor after accusing him of hitting her. She later withdrew that claim, and in January 2017, the couple agreed to a $7 million divorce settlement. An earlier defamation case. The trial follows another case Mr. Depp brought in London in 2020 against The Sun newspaper, which called him a “wife beater” in a headline. In that trial, a judge found that there was “overwhelming evidence” that he had assaulted Ms. Heard repeatedly during their marriage. The domestic abuse claims. In the 2020 trial, Ms. Heard accused her former husband of assaulting her first in 2013, after they began dating, and detailed other instances in which he slapped her, head-butted her and threw her to the ground. Mr. Depp has since accused her of punching him, kicking him and throwing objects at him. Ms. Heard remembered going to her car, leaning her head against the window and sitting there for a while before she drove home. Days later, she said, Mr. Depp was calling and texting to apologize profusely for what had happened, and then showed up with a couple cases of wine and said it would “never happen again.” “I knew it was wrong and I knew that I had to leave him,” Ms. Heard testified, “and that’s what broke my heart because I didn’t want to leave him.” In his testimony, Mr. Depp had denied slapping her, saying, “I’m certainly not going to strike a woman if she decides to make fun of a tattoo I have on my body.” Another time, Ms. Heard testified, Mr. Depp engaged in an invasive search of her body for drugs that he thought she was hiding from him. That search occurred after Mr. Depp had smashed objects in a trailer where the couple was vacationing, enraged that another woman who was with them had gotten too close physically to Ms. Heard, she said. (In his testimony, Mr. Depp said the woman had been “very affectionate” with Ms. Heard and so he had removed the woman’s hand from Ms. Heard. That led to an argument later between the couple in their trailer, during which he said he punched a sconce in the bathroom.) At the beginning of her testimony, Ms. Heard said it had been difficult to sit in the courtroom as Mr. Depp presented his case, listening as her ex-husband and others testified about their tumultuous relationship. “This is the most painful and difficult thing I have ever gone through,” Ms. Heard said.","amber heard actress defending defamation lawsuit filed husband johnny depp stand wednesday recalling whirlwind romance started movie set descended pattern violence perpetrated actor couple set rum diary movie depp produced starred fell love movie press tour ms heard testified depp repeatedly accusing infidelity anger escalate physical attacks denials explode ms heard recounting depp punch walls head shove ground slap repetitively ms heard grew emotional testimony explained physical confrontations graphic terms times appearing chagrined reasons staying relationship misgivings love life ms heard awful days testimony earlier trial fairfax county circuit court depp denied hitting ms heard woman accused aggressor relationship describing instances punched threw objects ms heard denied hitting depp defense defense sister provided account relationship divorce account depp erupt fits jealous rage drugs alcohol ms heard recalled depp accused affair slapped hand wore rings remember feeling lip teeth testified blood wall trial revolves op ed ms heard published washington post public figure representing domestic abuse depp sued ms heard op ed article alluding relationship publication devastating effect movie career ms heard countersued depp alleging defamed lawyer released statements allegations abuse hoax weeks trial depp lawyers called witnesses intention proving ms heard domestic abuse claims fictions severely damaged depp career sought prove ms heard primary abuser playing audio couple discussing incident depp ms heard kicked bathroom door head ms heard lawyers argued statements op ed true jury determines doesn evidence depp physically abused ms heard domestic abuse include verbal emotional abuse depp abused ms heard physically verbally emotionally psychologically time wins ben rottenborn lawyer ms heard court monday simple ms heard testified depp abused time hit married actress laughed tattoos slapped times gesture stunning initially responded laugh joke objected laughing realized jesting stared silently depp crying knees monster courtroom defamation trial involving married actors johnny depp amber heard underway fairfax county circuit court virginia depp brought defamation ms heard effort domestic abuse allegations denies jury countersuit ms heard claims depp defamed lawyer domestic abuse claims hoax ms heard op ed depp suit filed response op ed ms heard wrote washington post public figure representing domestic abuse mention husband lawyers argued referring relationship marriage ms heard filed divorce pair married obtained temporary restraining actor accusing hitting withdrew claim january couple agreed million divorce settlement earlier defamation trial depp brought london sun newspaper called wife beater headline trial judge found overwhelming evidence assaulted ms heard repeatedly marriage domestic abuse claims trial ms heard accused husband assaulting dating detailed instances slapped head butted threw ground depp accused punching kicking throwing objects ms heard remembered car leaning head window sitting drove home days depp calling texting apologize profusely happened couple wine happen wrong leave ms heard testified broke heart didn leave testimony depp denied slapping strike woman decides fun tattoo body time ms heard testified depp engaged invasive search body drugs hiding search occurred depp smashed objects trailer couple vacationing enraged woman close physically ms heard testimony depp woman affectionate ms heard removed woman hand ms heard led argument couple trailer punched sconce bathroom beginning testimony ms heard difficult sit courtroom depp listening husband testified tumultuous relationship painful difficult ms heard"
"An Anaconda’s Play Date With Dolphins Took a Strange Turn","In August 2021, a research team was documenting biodiversity near the Tijamuchi River in Bolivia when they saw some animals that are typically difficult to observe: Bolivian river dolphins. Just seeing them with their heads above the river was extraordinary, said Steffen Reichle, a biologist at the Noel Kempff Mercado Museum of Natural History in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, and a member of the team. They knew something was up and started snapping photos. Only after scrolling through the images the team captured did the researchers realize the dolphins were dangling an anaconda around as they swam. The researchers described what they saw in the journal Ecology last month. While dolphins in captivity and the wild are known for being playful, the surprising behavior of the Bolivian cetaceans seems like a new frontier in frolicking among the aquatic mammals, and some scientists still aren’t sure what to think about what the team observed. Dr. Reichle says Bolivian river dolphins usually swim below the surface, and sightings often catch only a fin or a tail. But some of the six animals they saw kept their heads above the turbid water for an unusually long time. At one point, two male dolphins seemingly swam in sync, a snake held by the animals’ mouths. Anacondas are semiaquatic and can hold their breaths for some time. But because the snake was handled for at least seven minutes, much of this submerged, it probably perished. “I don’t think that the snake had a very good time,” Dr. Reichle said. Because of how long this interaction went on, the team suspects play — not predation. Bolivia’s native Beni anacondas are apex predators. Other than a single case of cannibalism, researchers haven’t documented the serpents being eaten. In this case, the team did not see where the snake ended up. With how lively dolphins are, “playing seems like a pretty good answer,” said Omar Entiauspe-Neto, one of the paper’s authors and a taxonomist at Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil. Some of the dolphins gathered were juveniles, which could suggest another dimension of the interaction: The adults may have been teaching the youngsters about anacondas or showing them a hunting technique. But Sonja Wild, a behavioral ecologist at Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Germany, who was not part of the study, was skeptical that the interaction was purposely instructive. It’s more plausible the juveniles were observing because they were curious, she says. And because anacondas are strong, Dr. Wild wonders if the snake was injured or dead before the dolphins got to it. Of all the things one could pick up, “this seems a little extraordinary,” she said. “This is the first time I’ve heard of dolphins playing with a large snake,” added Dr. Wild, who has observed bottlenose dolphins using shells as tools. Something else from the photos was notable — the male dolphins’ erect penises. “It could have been sexually stimulating for them,” said Diana Reiss, a marine mammal scientist and cognitive psychologist at Hunter College in New York who was not involved with the study. “It could have been something to rub on.” The aroused males could have been having a sexual romp with each other before the snake became entangled. Researchers who study dolphins are well aware of the animals’ sexual proclivities, such as rubbing their genitals on toys or inserting their penises into objects, animate and inanimate. They often use their penises for tactile interactions, Dr. Reiss says. She has even observed male bottlenose dolphins trying to penetrate the blowhole of a rescued pilot whale in an aquarium. It’s possible, she added, that the males tried to insert their penises into the snake. “There are so many questions,” Mr. Entiauspe-Neto says. A lot more is known about ocean-dwelling dolphins than riverine ones, in part because it’s harder to see what’s going on when river water is muddy. Even though they’re limited in nature, “these observations are always valuable,” Dr. Reiss says. “It’s giving us another glimpse of the lives of these animals, particularly in the wild.” Whatever happened in this animal encounter, it’s not the stuff of children’s storybooks.","august research team documenting biodiversity tijamuchi river bolivia animals typically difficult observe bolivian river dolphins heads river extraordinary steffen reichle biologist noel kempff mercado museum natural history santa cruz de la sierra bolivia team started snapping photos scrolling images team captured researchers realize dolphins dangling anaconda swam researchers journal ecology month dolphins captivity wild playful surprising behavior bolivian cetaceans frontier frolicking aquatic mammals scientists aren team observed dr reichle bolivian river dolphins swim surface sightings catch fin tail animals heads turbid water unusually time male dolphins seemingly swam sync snake held animals mouths anacondas semiaquatic hold breaths time snake handled minutes submerged perished don snake time dr reichle interaction team suspects play predation bolivia native beni anacondas apex predators single cannibalism researchers haven documented serpents eaten team snake lively dolphins playing pretty answer omar entiauspe neto paper authors taxonomist universidade federal rio grande sul brazil dolphins gathered juveniles suggest dimension interaction adults teaching youngsters anacondas hunting technique sonja wild behavioral ecologist max planck institute animal behavior germany study skeptical interaction purposely instructive plausible juveniles observing curious anacondas strong dr wild wonders snake injured dead dolphins pick extraordinary time ve heard dolphins playing snake added dr wild observed bottlenose dolphins shells tools photos notable male dolphins erect penises sexually stimulating diana reiss marine mammal scientist cognitive psychologist hunter college york involved study rub aroused males sexual romp snake entangled researchers study dolphins aware animals sexual proclivities rubbing genitals toys inserting penises objects animate inanimate penises tactile interactions dr reiss observed male bottlenose dolphins penetrate blowhole rescued pilot whale aquarium added males insert penises snake questions entiauspe neto lot ocean dwelling dolphins riverine harder river water muddy limited nature observations valuable dr reiss giving glimpse lives animals wild happened animal encounter stuff children storybooks"
"As Leak Theories Circulate, Supreme Court Marshal Takes Up Investigation","WASHINGTON — Maybe it was a liberal law clerk who leaked the draft opinion in the Supreme Court’s biggest case in years, hoping to gin up outrage among Democrats at the prospect of an end to legal abortions. Or it was an anti-abortion court employee fearful that the justices would end up backing away from their early agreement to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark case legalizing the procedure. Or perhaps it was one of the justices themselves, frustrated by the direction of their secret internal debates about one of the country’s most polarizing issues. Not since Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein refused for decades to disclose the identity of their shadowy, meet-me-in-the-parking-garage Watergate source has Washington been as eager to unmask a leaker. But while the city’s lobbyists, journalists and political operatives trade theories over encrypted messages and social media, Col. Gail A. Curley, the 11th marshal of the United States Supreme Court has been given the task of rooting out the truth in what Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. called “a singular and egregious breach” of the court’s operations. Hours after Politico posted what appeared to be a photocopy of a Feb. 10 draft opinion in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the chief justice confirmed the document’s authenticity and did the most Washington of things: He ordered Colonel Curley to conduct a thorough leak investigation. And with that, the bright D.C. spotlight turns to a former senior Army attorney whose legal work took her from the United States to Germany and Afghanistan. The second woman to hold the marshal position at the court, Colonel Curley serves as the chief security officer, facilities administrator and head of contracting for the third branch of the federal government. She manages about 260 employees, including the court’s police force, and is a voice that might be recognizable to anyone who has attended or listened to any of the court’s oral arguments. “Oyez! Oyez! Oyez!” she announces at the start of every public meeting of the court. “All persons having business before the honorable, the Supreme Court of the United States, are admonished to give their attention, for the court is now sitting. God save the United States and this honorable court.” People familiar with court operations said Colonel Curley is not normally charged with conducting investigations. But it will now be up to her to help save the reputation of the court, which has been badly tarnished by the disclosure, as many Washingtonians lamented this week. The contours of her investigation are opaque, even by Washington standards. It is unclear how she might conduct an inquiry, whom she will interview, and what punishments the court could dole out if she tracks down the perpetrator. More than most of the federal government, the Supreme Court operates in almost total secrecy — a tradition that helps the court maintain a sense of being above the contentious political wars that so often consume the executive and legislative branches. On Wednesday, the court offered no insight into how the leak investigation will be conducted and did not respond to requests for comment. But there are some obvious places Colonel Curley might start to look for clues. The document Politico posted online appeared to be slightly askew, as if it had been placed hastily on a photocopy machine or scanner. The top left corner was dog-eared and looked as if a large staple were removed from the 98-page draft opinion. And the words “1st Draft” are highlighted in yellow — though it is not clear whether that was done with a highlighter pen or with a highlight feature on a word processor. Those physical characteristics could help Colonel Curley track down the source of the leak. Only some of the employees at the court would have had access to the document, according to people who have worked there in the past. Each justice has chambers downstairs, which include offices for their clerks, a personal secretary and a conference secretary, and one chamber aide. Each justice also has more offices for clerks upstairs in the court building. Draft opinions are normally emailed to the offices of other justices and are sometimes printed and distributed among the justices, the clerks, and the conference secretaries. Each of them could potentially be a target for questioning. Dan Epps, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis who clerked for former Justice Anthony Kennedy in 2009 and 2010, said some of the justices might balk at the idea of their clerks being subjected to interrogation. “Some of them might just be a little bit wary of subjecting their clerks and their staff to the kind of jurisdiction of somebody else who’s not in their chambers,” he said. “My guess is, you know, some of them would just say, ‘I will have a conversation with my clerks personally.’” Mr. Epps said it is not out of the question that the justices might share their work with family members. (A common conspiracy theory on Twitter — offered with no evidence — is that Ginni Thomas, a conservative political activist and the wife of Justice Clarence Thomas, leaked the draft.) And some people have mused online about the possibility that the court’s computers might have been hacked by someone who then gave the draft to Politico — though there is no public evidence of such an event. There has also been much speculation about the authors of the Politico report, and whom they might know inside the court. Josh Gerstein is a veteran legal affairs reporter who is well connected across Washington. He is also a prodigious user of the Freedom of Information Act to wrest information out of federal agencies whose leaders are not so inclined to see their emails and memos in the press. He has covered the court for years. Alex Ward, Mr. Gerstein’s co-author, is a less likely candidate to have a byline on the story. A national security reporter, Mr. Ward has covered the White House and was an associate director in the Atlantic Council’s Brent Scowcroft Center on International Security, according to his bio on Politico’s website. While the disclosure of a draft opinion months before the court’s official ruling has never happened, there have been a few other leaks — and at least one investigation. In 1973, the original Roe v. Wade opinion was leaked by a clerk to Time magazine, which had agreed to wait to publish the decision until after the court had announced it. Because of a slight delay in the court’s announcement, the article appeared several hours before the justices made it public. Warren Burger, the chief justice at the time, was furious. In that case, however, the clerk in question quickly admitted what he had done and apologized, according to an account of the episode by James D. Robenalt, the author of “January 1973: Watergate, Roe v. Wade, Vietnam, and the Month That Changed America Forever.” Six years later, Justice Burger did order a leak investigation after Tim O’Brien, a Supreme Court correspondent for ABC News, disclosed the decision in a case involving libel laws. The chief justice apparently never discovered the source of Mr. O’Brien’s scoops, though one report suggested that he suspected someone in the court’s printing office, who would have had access to the final drafts. In the current case, Chief Justice Roberts called the leak a “betrayal” of trust. Protective of the court’s credibility and pained by erosion of its public standing, he seems intent on keeping the matter confined to the court and affirming the separation of powers among the three branches, no matter who leaked the opinion. Chief Justice Roberts provided no details of how an investigation will proceed or how rigorous it might be, but he has rejected suggestions, made by conservative politicians and pundits, that he seek investigative help outside the judicial branch by enlisting help from the Department of Justice and F.B.I. “There’s no criminal statute that I know of that makes this illegal — so what’s the point in bringing outsiders in?” said Paul Schiff Berman, a law professor at George Washington University who served as a clerk for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Gabe Roth, the executive director of Fix The Court, a nonprofit group that pushes to make the Supreme Court more accountable to the people, said the leak investigation amounted to a massive task for the Supreme Court marshal, a job he described as <U+200B><U+200B>“more administrative than investigatory” in nature. “The marshal’s like the C.O.O. of the Supreme Court,” Mr. Roth said. “They concern themselves with overseeing the police, overseeing hirings. They’re involved in the budget proposals that are released every year. They’re involved in ensuring decorum is maintained during an open Supreme Court session.” Colonel Curley replaced Pamela Talkin, who retired from the role in July 2020. Before that, she supervised a team of Army judges and lawyers as the chief of the national security law division in the Office of The Judge Advocate General for the U.S. Army. She was also tasked with providing advice on national security law to Army leadership. Colonel Curley was the staff judge advocate for the Army in Germany from 2016 to 2019. She has also handled legal matters for the Army in Afghanistan. Mr. Epps, the former clerk to Justice Kennedy, said that despite her background, Colonel Curley might have to hire someone from outside the court to examine computers or conduct interviews because the marshal’s office does not have a well-developed investigative team. “This is not Scotland Yard,” he said.

"Death Toll During Pandemic Far Exceeds Totals Reported by Countries, W.H.O. Says","Nearly 15 million more people died during the pandemic than would have in normal times, the World Health Organization said on Thursday, a staggering measure of Covid’s true toll that laid bare how vastly country after country has undercounted victims. In Mexico, the excess death toll during the first two years of the pandemic was twice as high as the government’s official tally of Covid deaths, the W.H.O. found. In Egypt, excess deaths were roughly 12 times as great as the official Covid toll. In Pakistan, the figure was eight times as high. Those estimates, calculated by a global panel of experts assembled by the W.H.O., represent what many scientists see as the most reliable gauge of the total impact of the pandemic. Faced with large gaps in global death data, the expert team set out to calculate excess mortality: the difference between the number of people who died in 2020 and 2021 and the number who would have been expected to die during that time if the pandemic had not happened. Their calculations combined national data on reported deaths with new information from localities and household surveys, and with statistical models that aimed to account for deaths that were missed. Most of the excess deaths were victims of Covid itself, the experts said, but some died because the pandemic made it more difficult to get medical care for ailments such as heart attacks. The previous toll, based solely on death counts reported by countries, was six million. Much of the loss of life from the pandemic was concentrated in 2021, when more contagious variants tore through even countries that had fended off earlier outbreaks. Overall deaths that year were roughly 18 percent higher — an extra 10 million people — than they would have been without the pandemic, the W.H.O.-assembled experts estimated. Developing nations bore the brunt of the devastation, with nearly eight million more people than expected dying in lower-middle-income nations during the pandemic. “It’s absolutely staggering what has happened with this pandemic, including our inability to accurately monitor it,” said Dr. Prabhat Jha, an epidemiologist at St. Michael’s Hospital and the University of Toronto, who was a member of the expert working group that made the calculations. “It shouldn’t happen in the 21st century.” The figures had been ready since January, but their release was stalled by objections from India, which disputes the methodology for calculating how many of its citizens died. Nearly a third of the excess deaths globally — 4.7 million — took place in India, according to the W.H.O. estimates. The Indian government’s own figure through the end of 2021 is 481,080 deaths. But India was far from the only country where deaths were substantially underreported. Where excess deaths far outstripped the number of reported Covid fatalities, experts said the gap could reflect countries’ struggles to collect mortality data or their efforts to intentionally obscure the toll of the pandemic. In some countries, flaws in government reports were widely known. Russia, for example, had reported roughly 310,000 Covid deaths by the end of 2021, but the W.H.O. experts indicated that the excess death toll was nearly 1.1 million. That mirrored earlier estimates from a Russian national statistics agency that is fairly independent of the government. Aleksei Raksha, an independent demographer who quit the Russian state statistics service after complaining of the failure to count Covid deaths properly, said that informal orders had been given to local authorities to ensure that in many cases, Covid was not registered as the primary cause of death. “Excess deaths have established the true picture,” Mr. Raksha said. “Russia demonstrated a dismal performance in fighting the pandemic.” In other nations, W.H.O. experts used what limited data was available to arrive at estimates jarringly at odds with previous counts, though they cautioned that some of those calculations remained highly uncertain. In Indonesia, for example, the experts leaned heavily on monthly death data from Jakarta, the capital, to estimate that the country had experienced over a million more deaths than normal. That figure would be seven times as high as the reported Covid death toll. Siti Nadia Tarmizi, a spokeswoman for the government’s Covid-19 vaccination program, acknowledged that Indonesia had suffered more deaths than the government had reported. She said the problem stemmed in part from people not reporting relatives’ deaths to avoid complying with government rules for Covid victims’ funerals. But she said that the W.H.O. estimates were far too high. In Pakistan, Dr. Faisal Sultan, a former health minister, defended the government’s death reports, saying that studies of the number of graveyard burials in major cities did not reveal large numbers of uncounted victims of the pandemic. For still other countries that suffered grievously during the pandemic, the W.H.O. estimates illuminated even more startling figures hiding inside already devastating death counts. In Peru, for instance, the expert estimate of 290,000 excess deaths by the end of 2021 was only 1.4 times as high as the reported Covid death toll. But the W.H.O. estimate of 437 excess deaths for every 100,000 Peruvians left the country with among the world’s highest per capita tolls. “When a health care system isn’t prepared to receive patients who are seriously ill with pneumonia, when it can’t provide the oxygen they need to live, or even provide beds for them to lay in so they can have some peace, you get what you’ve gotten,” said Dr. Elmer Huerta, an oncologist and public health specialist who hosts a popular radio show in Peru. In the United States, the W.H.O. estimated that roughly 930,000 more people than expected had died by the end of 2021, compared with the 820,000 Covid deaths that had been officially recorded over the same period. In Mexico, the government has itself kept a tally of excess deaths during the pandemic that appears roughly in line with the W.H.O.’s. Those estimates — about double the country’s reported Covid death toll — reflected what analysts there described as difficulties counting the dead. “We responded badly, we reacted slowly. But I think the most serious of all was to not communicate the urgency, the wanting to minimize, minimize,” said Xavier Tello, a public health analyst based in Mexico City. “Because Mexico wasn’t or isn’t testing for Covid, a lot of people died and we don’t know if they had Covid.” The W.H.O.’s calculations include people who died directly from Covid, from medical conditions complicated by Covid, or because they had ailments other than Covid but could not get needed treatment because of the pandemic. The excess death estimates also take into account expected deaths that did not occur because of Covid restrictions, such as reductions in traffic accidents or isolation that prevented deaths from the flu and other infectious diseases. Calculating excess deaths is complex, the W.H.O. experts said. About half of countries globally do not regularly report the number of deaths from all causes. Others supply only partial data. In the W.H.O.’s African region, the experts said that they had data from only six of 47 countries. Scientists also noted that excess death rates were not necessarily indicative of a country’s pandemic response: Older and younger populations will fare differently in a pandemic, regardless of the response. And the W.H.O. experts said that they did not account for the effects of heat waves or conflicts. Where death figures were missing, the statisticians had to rely on modeling. In those cases, they made predictions based on country-specific information like containment measures, historical rates of disease, temperature and demographics to assemble national figures and, from there, regional and global estimates. W.H.O. officials used the release of their calculations to plead for greater investment in death reporting. “When we underestimate, we may underinvest,” said Dr. Samira Asma, the W.H.O.’s assistant director general for data, analytics and delivery for impact. “And when we undercount, we may miss targeting the interventions where they are needed most.” W.H.O. officials cited Britain as an example of a country that had accurately recorded Covid deaths: Their analysis found that about 149,000 more people than normal had died during the pandemic, nearly identical to the number of Covid deaths Britain reported. The disagreement over India’s Covid deaths spilled into public this week when the Indian government on Tuesday abruptly released mortality data from 2020, reporting an 11 percent increase in registered deaths in 2020 compared with average annual deaths registered over the two prior years. Analysts saw the release as an attempt to force the W.H.O. to reconsider its calculations on the eve of publication. Indian health officials said their figures showed that the country had lost fewer people to Covid than outside estimates suggested. But scientists believe that most of the country’s excess mortality occurred in 2021, during a grievous wave caused by the Delta variant. And even India’s 2020 figures gave additional credence to the W.H.O. estimates, said Dr. Jha, who has also studied excess deaths in India. “The Indian government wanted to deflect the news,” he said, “but they’re confirming, at least for 2020, the W.H.O. numbers.” Other experts said that India’s refusal to cooperate with the W.H.O. analysis was rooted in the country’s history of ignoring how data can inform policymaking. “It’s natural to miss some of the Covid deaths,” said Dr. Bhramar Mukherjee, a professor of biostatistics at the University of Michigan School of Public Health who has been working with the W.H.O. to review the data. But, she added, “Nobody’s been this resistant.” The Ministry of Health in New Delhi did not respond to requests for comment. W.H.O. officials said that India’s 2020 death figures were released too late to be incorporated into their calculations but that they would “carefully review” the data. Nations that report Covid deaths more accurately have also been at the center of disputes over the reliability of excess death estimates. In Germany, for example, the W.H.O. experts estimated that 195,000 more people than normal had died during the pandemic, a significantly higher toll than the 112,000 Covid deaths recorded there. But Giacomo De Nicola, a statistician at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, who has studied excess deaths in Germany, said that the country’s rapidly aging population meant that the W.H.O. analysis might have underestimated the number of people who would have been expected to die in a normal year. That, in turn, could have produced overestimates of excess deaths. He said that the W.H.O.-assembled experts had accounted for trends in mortality, but not directly for changes in the age structure of the population. While Germany experienced excess deaths, he said, the W.H.O. estimate for the country “seems very high.” Overall, the W.H.O. calculations were more conservative than separate analyses released earlier by The Economist and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. Some experts said that the W.H.O. analysis benefited from relying more heavily than other estimates on actual data, even where it was incomplete, as opposed to statistical modeling.

"Elon Musk Left a South Africa That Was Rife With Misinformation and White Privilege","Elon Musk’s impending takeover of Twitter has many people probing his public statements and his past for clues about how he will shape one of the world’s most influential public platforms. But Mr. Musk, best known for owning the companies Tesla and SpaceX, has not talked much in public about a significant swath of his past: How growing up as a white person under the racist apartheid system in South Africa may have shaped him. “It’s telling — white kids were insulated from the harsh reality of it,” said Terence Beney, who is white and graduated with Mr. Musk from Pretoria Boys High School in 1988. Interviews with relatives and former classmates reveal an upbringing in elite, segregated white communities that were littered with anti-Black government propaganda, and detached from the atrocities that white political leaders inflicted on the Black majority. Mr. Musk, 50, grew up in the economic hub of Johannesburg, the executive capital of Pretoria and the coastal city of Durban. His suburban communities were largely shrouded in misinformation. Newspapers sometimes arrived on doorsteps with whole sections blacked out, and nightly news bulletins ended with the national anthem and an image of the national flag flapping as the names of white young men who were killed fighting for the government scrolled on the screen. “We were really clueless as white South African teenagers. Really clueless,” said Melanie Cheary, a classmate of Mr. Musk’s during the two years he spent at Bryanston High School in the northern suburbs of Johannesburg, where Black people were rarely seen other than in service of white families living in palatial homes. Mr. Musk left South Africa shortly after graduation at 17 to go to college in Canada, barely ever looking back. He did not respond to emails requesting comment about his childhood. Mr. Musk has heralded his purchase of Twitter as a victory for free speech, having criticized the platform for removing posts and banning users. It is unclear what role his childhood — coming up in a time and place in which there was hardly a free exchange of ideas and where government misinformation was used to demonize Black South Africans — may have played in that decision. Classmates at two high schools he attended described him as a loner with no close friends. None offered recollections of things he said or did that revealed his views on the politics of the time. But Black schoolmates recall that he spent time with Black friends. Mr. Musk’s father, Errol Musk, said in an interview with The New York Times that Elon, his brother and sister were aware from a young age that there was something wrong with the apartheid system. Errol, who was elected to the Pretoria City Council in 1972, said they would ask him about the laws prohibiting Black people from patronizing restaurants, movie theaters and beaches. They had to make calculations when they were going out with nonwhite friends about what they could safely do, he said. “As far as being sheltered from it, that’s nonsense. They were confronted by it every day,” recalled Errol, who said he belonged to the anti-apartheid Progressive Party. He added, “They didn’t like it.” Still, Errol offered a description of their lives that underscored how removed they were from the country’s violent reality. They got along well with Black people, he said, pointing to his children’s good relationship with their domestic staff, and he described life in South Africa during apartheid as being mostly better and safer than it is now. According to a biography of Mr. Musk, written by Ashlee Vance, Mr. Musk said he did not want to partake in South Africa’s mandatory military service because it would have forced him to participate in the apartheid regime — and that may have contributed to his decision to leave South Africa shortly after high school graduation. The apartheid system created a distinction among white people, specifically between those who spoke Afrikaans and those who spoke English, like Mr. Musk’s family. While political power lay with the Afrikaners — the perfecters of apartheid who descended from Dutch, German and French settlers — English-speaking white South Africans enjoyed wealth that felt to some like a birthright, Ms. Cheary said. “We were the white, English-speaking elite of the world,” she said. “It was literally our kingdom.” Pretoria Boys had a socially progressive undercurrent. The school’s headmaster had participated in freedom struggle activities; some students would travel to anti-apartheid gatherings. “I’m pretty confident in saying that at a place like Pretoria Boys High, you were exposed to progressive ideas, even if you didn’t adopt them,” said Mr. Beney, 51, who does policy work for public health and social welfare organizations. Yet none of them experienced the beatings and gunshots of state security forces like the Black children who were fighting for basic rights in township schools. And many students bought into government propaganda, Mr. Beney said. He recalled a debate in one of his classes at Pretoria Boys in the mid-1980s over the government’s requirement that they serve in the military, squashing efforts by Black South Africans to defeat an oppressive regime. A slight few said they would refuse to kill on behalf of an unjust political system. But others said that while apartheid had its injustices, the country was in an all-out war. Some insisted that the fight was to protect against communists. Others justified the battle by arguing that Black people were susceptible to evil ideas. Another common trope among students back then, Mr. Beney said, was that Black people could not be trusted with the right to vote because they had no tradition of democracy. The apartheid system had forced the Black majority to live in certain areas. The way that was taught in school was that the country was made up of many tribes, with some opting for independence in their own homelands, according to Stanley Netshituka, who became the first Black student at Pretoria Boys in 1981. Mr. Netshituka said he had some friends from liberal families who understood how bad things were for Black South Africans. But they were the exception, he said. “I would say the majority were blissfully ignorant and happy to be blissfully ignorant,” said Mr. Netshituka, 54, who was allowed to attend the school because his father was a diplomat for Venda, one of the ethnic homelands in South Africa that was considered a semi-independent nation at the time. In the same breath, classmates would call Black freedom fighters terrorists but tell him that, “Not all Black people are necessarily bad because I can see you’re not so bad,” he recalled. Mr. Musk became friends with a cousin of Mr. Netshituka’s, Asher Mashudu, according to Mr. Mashudu’s brother, Nyadzani Ranwashe. One time at lunch, a white student used an anti-Black slur, and Mr. Musk chided the student, but then got bullied for doing so, Mr. Ranwashe said. A blockbuster deal. Elon Musk, the world’s wealthiest man, capped what seemed an improbable attempt by the famously mercurial billionaire to buy Twitter for roughly $44 billion. Here’s how the deal unfolded: The initial offer. Mr. Musk made an unsolicited bid worth more than $40 billion for the influential social network, saying that he wanted to make Twitter a private company and that he wanted people to be able to speak more freely on the service. The response. Twitter’s board countered Mr. Musk’s offer with a defense mechanism known as a “poison pill.” This well-worn corporate tactic makes a company less palatable to a potential acquirer by making it more expensive for them to buy shares above a certain threshold. Securing financing. Though his original offer had scant details and was received skeptically by Wall Street, Mr. Musk has been moving swiftly to secure commitments worth $46.5 billion to finance his bid, putting pressure on Twitter’s board to take his advances seriously. Striking a deal. With the financing in place, Twitter’s board met with Mr. Musk to discuss his offer. The two sides soon reached a deal, with the social media company agreeing to sell itself for $54.20 a share. What’s next? Shareholders will vote on the offer, which will also be reviewed by regulators. The deal is expected to take three to six months to close. In the meantime, scrutiny is likely to be intense and several questions remain about Mr. Musk’s plans for the company. Mr. Mashudu was killed in a car accident in 1987, and Mr. Ranwashe said he remembered Mr. Musk being one of only a handful of white people who attended the funeral in the family’s rural village. “It was unheard of during that time,” he said. Errol Musk, who worked as an engineer, said that his family did not buy into the negative propaganda about freedom fighters, some of whom had resorted to violent sabotage to combat a regime that stripped them of political rights and freedoms like choosing where to live. “But, I mean, we were concerned about them putting off a bomb next to our house, for example,” he said. Errol Musk, who has been estranged from Elon, said he believed that apartheid had taught his son not to discriminate. But Elon’s electric car company, Tesla, has faced serious accusations of racism. The state of California is investigating accusations that the company allowed racial discrimination against Black employees to flourish in its factory in the San Francisco area. Tesla was also ordered to pay $15 million to a Black employee after a jury found last year that the company had failed to address the racism he faced at work. Elon Musk has largely recalled his life in South Africa as traumatic and unfulfilling. Born in Pretoria, about 45 minutes north of Johannesburg, his parents divorced before he was 10. He moved to Durban on the country’s south coast with his mother, but then returned to live with his father in Pretoria. They had a tense relationship, Mr. Musk has said. At Bryanston High, where Mr. Musk completed the first two years of the five-year South African high school curriculum, he recalled being bullied heavily. If Bryanston High was said to be traumatic for him, Mr. Musk found more stability at Pretoria Boys, a sprawling campus fit for a Harry Potter set, with a forest of evergreens, a pond and English-revival buildings. Some students lived on campus, while others, like Mr. Musk, commuted from home and were known as “day boys.” The specter of apartheid was imbued in the culture. Like many other schools of that era, there was a cadet program that groomed the boys for military service. They would wear brown uniforms and do marching drills. There was a Scottish pipe band. Mr. Musk’s current views on free speech seem to reflect the philosophies students were exposed to at Pretoria Boys, said Mr. Beney, the classmate — like that of the English philosopher John Stuart Mill, a champion of unchecked expression. “I think his ideas about free speech are very classic liberal and not nuanced,” Mr. Beney said of Mr. Musk. Some who knew Mr. Musk from his young days in South Africa said people should not discount the evolution he could have gone through once he left apartheid and South Africa behind. Andrew Panzera, who was in German class with Mr. Musk at Bryanston High, recalled his own transformation. As a white student coming up in the placid Johannesburg suburbs, he never saw the suffering of his Black counterparts. That changed, though, when he did his government-mandated military service. “People, at some point, realize that they’ve been fed a whole lot of crap,” he said. “At some point you go, ‘Jeepers, we really were indoctrinated to a large extent.’” Kitty Bennett contributed research.","elon musk impending takeover twitter people probing public statements past clues shape world influential public

"Goodwill Sold a Bust for $34.99. It’s an Ancient Roman Relic.","Laura Young was browsing through a Goodwill store in Austin, Texas, in 2018 when she found a bust for sale. It was resting on the floor, under a table, and had a yellow price tag slapped on its cheek: $34.99. She bought it. Turns out, it wasn’t just another heavy stone curio suitable for plunking in the garden. It was an actual Roman bust from the late 1st century B.C. or early 1st century A.D., which had been part of a Bavarian king’s art collection from the 19th century until it was looted during World War II. How it got to Texas remains a mystery. But the most likely path suggests it was taken by an American soldier after the Bavarian king’s villa in Germany was bombed by Allied forces. This week, it went on display at the San Antonio Museum of Art, next to signage acknowledging Ms. Young’s role in discovering it after the bust’s improbable, 2,000-year journey from ancient Rome to the Goodwill Boutique on Far West Boulevard. Next year, it will be returned to the Bavarian government under an agreement with Ms. Young that ended her own complex relationship with the ancient artifact, which she had kept on a credenza in her living room for the last three and a half years. She had named it “Dennis Reynolds,” after a character from the comedy series “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.” Like that vain and narcissistic cad, the 52-pound marble bust was “a very difficult, cold, aloof, emotionless man that caused some problems for me,” Ms. Young said. When Ms. Young, a dealer of antique and vintage goods, first spotted the bust, as reported by KUT in Austin and the The Art Newspaper, she knew it was probably valuable. “I got it outside in the light,” she said. “He had chips to the base. He had clear repairs. He looks old. I’ve been to museums. I’ve seen Roman portrait heads before.” She did a Google image search for “Roman bust” and realized, “They look a lot like my guy.” After taking the bust home, strapped in a seatbelt in the front seat of her car, she contacted two auction houses, Bonhams and Sotheby’s, both of which confirmed that her hunch was right: The bust was from ancient Rome. Ms. Young was on vacation, celebrating her 40th birthday, when she got the email from Bonhams. She wanted to return home immediately. “He was at my house, alone,” she said. But subsequent research, authenticated by the Bavarian government, soon confirmed that Ms. Young would not be able to sell the piece, and fulfill the fantasy of anyone who has ever haunted Goodwill stores and yard sales for priceless treasures. At some point before 1833, the bust had been acquired by Ludwig I, a Bavarian king, who displayed it in the courtyard of the Pompejanum, his replica of a Roman villa in Pompeii, in the Bavarian town of Aschaffenburg, according to Ms. Young’s lawyer, Leila A. Amineddoleh. The Pompejanum was heavily damaged by Allied bombing in 1944 and 1945, and although some of its objects survived, others disappeared, Ms. Amineddoleh said. The looting of art by the Nazis has gained widespread attention. But because the bust ended up in Texas, it is likely that an American service member either stole it or traded for it after the war, Ms. Amineddoleh said. That meant Ms. Young was not the rightful owner because Germany had never sold the piece or abandoned the title to it, Ms. Amineddoleh said. Ms. Young said Goodwill was also unable to provide answers about the bust’s origins. “Immediately, I was like, ‘OK, I cannot keep him and I also cannot sell him,’” Ms. Young said. “It was extremely bittersweet, to say the least. But I only have control over what I can control, and art theft, looting during a war, is a war crime. I can’t be a party to it.” So Ms. Young struck an agreement to have the bust shipped back to Bavaria. In exchange, she will receive only a “small finder’s fee,” which Ms. Amineddoleh declined to disclose. “We are very pleased that a piece of Bavarian history that we thought was lost has reappeared and will soon be able to return to its rightful location,” Bernd Schreiber, president of the Bavarian Administration of State-Owned Palaces, Gardens and Lakes, said in a statement released by the San Antonio Museum of Art. The bust is believed to portray either a son of Pompey the Great, who was defeated in battle by Julius Caesar, or Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus, a Roman commander whose forces once occupied German territory. The San Antonio Museum of Art will display the bust until May 2023, which was important to Ms. Young. “He’s been hidden for 70 to 80 years; I think he deserves some attention,” she said. “And I think he deserves some attention in Texas.” Last month, she handed over the bust to the museum, leaving her with only a 3D-printed model of the piece that she keeps in her living room. “It’s hard a little bit because this is probably going to be the coolest thing I ever find, and it’s over,” Ms. Young said. “But there’s always something else to find. If you’re an antiques dealer, there’s always something else.”","laura browsing goodwill store austin texas found bust sale resting floor table yellow price tag slapped cheek bought wasn heavy stone curio suitable plunking garden actual roman bust late st century st century bavarian king art collection th century looted world war ii texas remains mystery path suggests american soldier bavarian king villa germany bombed allied forces week display san antonio museum art signage acknowledging ms role discovering bust improbable journey ancient rome goodwill boutique west boulevard returned bavarian government agreement ms complex relationship ancient artifact credenza living half named dennis reynolds character comedy series sunny philadelphia vain narcissistic cad pound marble bust difficult cold aloof emotionless caused ms ms dealer antique vintage spotted bust reported kut austin art newspaper valuable light chips base repairs ve museums ve roman portrait heads google image search roman bust realized lot guy taking bust home strapped seatbelt front seat car contacted auction houses bonhams sotheby confirmed hunch bust ancient rome ms vacation celebrating th birthday email bonhams return home immediately house subsequent research authenticated bavarian government confirmed ms sell piece fulfill fantasy haunted goodwill stores yard sales priceless treasures bust acquired ludwig bavarian king displayed courtyard pompejanum replica roman villa pompeii bavarian town aschaffenburg ms lawyer leila amineddoleh pompejanum heavily damaged allied bombing objects survived disappeared ms amineddoleh looting art nazis gained widespread attention bust texas american service stole traded war ms amineddoleh meant ms rightful owner germany sold piece abandoned title ms amineddoleh ms goodwill unable provide answers bust origins immediately sell ms extremely bittersweet control control art theft looting war war crime party ms struck agreement bust shipped bavaria exchange receive finder fee ms amineddoleh declined disclose pleased piece bavarian history lost reappeared return rightful location bernd schreiber president bavarian administration owned palaces gardens lakes statement released san antonio museum art bust believed portray son pompey defeated battle julius caesar nero claudius drusus germanicus roman commander forces occupied german territory san antonio museum art display bust ms hidden deserves attention deserves attention texas month handed bust museum leaving d printed model piece living hard bit coolest ms antiques dealer"
"He Spurred a Revolution in Psychiatry. Then He ‘Disappeared.’","To hear more audio stories from publications like The New York Times, download Audm for iPhone or Android. On the second day of the annual convention of the American Psychiatric Association in 1972, something extraordinary happened. While the assembled psychiatrists, mostly white men in dark suits, settled into rows of chairs in the Danish Room at the Adolphus Hotel in Dallas, a disguised figure had been smuggled through the back corridors. At the last minute, he stepped through a side curtain and took his place at the front of the room. There was an intake of breath in the audience. The man’s appearance was grotesque. His face was covered by a rubber Nixon mask, and he was wearing a garish, oversized tuxedo and a curly fright wig. But the outlandishness of his outfit diminished in importance once he began to speak. “I am a homosexual,” he began. “I am a psychiatrist.” For the next 10 minutes, Henry Anonymous, M.D. — this is what he had asked to be called — described the secret world of gay psychiatrists. Officially, they did not exist; homosexuality was categorized as a mental illness, so acknowledging it would result in the revocation of one’s medical license, and the loss of a career. In 42 states, sodomy was a crime. The reality was that there were plenty of gay people in the A.P.A., psychiatry’s most influential professional body, the masked doctor explained. But they lived in hiding, concealing every trace of their private life from their colleagues. “All of us have something to lose,” he said. “We may not be under consideration for a professorship; the analyst down the street may stop referring us his overflow; our supervisor may ask us to take a leave of absence.” This was the trade-off that had formed the basis of the masked man’s life. But the cost was too high. That’s what he had come to tell them. “We are taking an even bigger risk, however, in not living fully our humanity,” he said. “This is the greatest loss, our honest humanity.” He took his seat to a standing ovation. The 10-minute speech, delivered 50 years ago Monday, was a tipping point in the history of gay rights. The following year, the A.P.A. announced that it would reverse its nearly century-old position, declaring that homosexuality was not a mental disorder. It is rare for psychiatrists to transform the culture that surrounds them, but that is what happened in 1973. By removing the diagnosis from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or D.S.M., psychiatry removed the legal basis for a wide range of discriminatory practices: for denying gay people the right to employment, citizenship, housing and the custody of children; for excluding them from the clergy and the military and the institution of marriage. The long process of rolling back those practices could begin. When referred to psychiatrists, gay people would no longer be sent to be “cured” — injected with hormones, subjected to aversion therapy or pored over by analysts — but instead told that, from the point of view of science, there was nothing intrinsically wrong with them. After delivering his speech, the man in the mask, John Ercel Fryer, 34, flew from Dallas to his home in Philadelphia, noting in his journal just how terrifying and profound the experience had been. “The day has passed, it has come and gone and I am still alive. For the first time I have identified with a force that is akin to my selfhood,” he wrote, in excerpts included in “Cured,” a 2020 documentary. Still — he didn’t tell his mother he had done it. He didn’t tell his sister. He didn’t tell his closest childhood friend. He barely told anybody for 20 years. Dr. Fryer, who died in 2003 at the age of 65, stood out for his size (he was 6-foot-4 and 300 pounds), for his flashing intelligence, and for the fact that he was obviously gay. Betty Lollis, a friend from Winchester, Ky., recalled him as the round-faced boy who was led into her second-grade class, dressed by his mother in a sailor suit. He was a prodigy, she said, and also “just a boy the boys laughed at or teased.” Decades later, Ms. Lollis said, some of their classmates apologized to Dr. Fryer for the way they had treated him. “These people that were painful for him were also all he had,” she said. “Those are his dearest friends.” He sailed through his classes, enrolling in college at 15 and medical school at 19. But again and again, his path was blocked when supervisors learned he was gay. The most crushing of these setbacks occurred in 1964. He had relocated to the freer atmosphere of the East Coast, and was a few months into a residency at the University of Pennsylvania when he let his guard down, telling a family friend at dinner that he was gay. The young man immediately reported this to his father, who reported it to the department chairman at Penn, Dr. Fryer said in a 2002 interview with the Journal of Gay and Lesbian Psychiatry. The department chairman called Dr. Fryer into his office and said: “You can either resign or I’ll fire you.” It took years of humiliating assignments at a state-run psychiatric hospital, the only institution that accepted him, for Dr. Fryer to complete his residency. After that he faced a long, uncertain path to tenure. For these reasons, coming out had little appeal, he said in a 2001 interview for “This American Life,” much of which has not been published until now. “It was a way, if you came out as gay, to not have any power,” he said. “And I wanted to be powerful. So being a straight, closeted physician enabled me to have power.” In 1970, Frank Kameny, an astronomer who had been dismissed from the military because he was gay, led a small group of gay rights activists to protest the A.P.A.’s annual convention, demanding that the diagnosis be declassified. Dr. Fryer was a full-fledged member of the “Gay P.A.,” a group of closeted A.P.A. members who gathered in secret on the edges of the association, and he watched with distaste as the protesters stormed into panel discussions and heckled the speakers. “I was embarrassed by it, and I wished that they would shut up,” he said. But the following year, Barbara Gittings, one of the activists, approached Dr. Fryer to ask for his help. Younger, more progressive leaders were rising through the ranks of the A.P.A., and the activists sensed an opening. They had an idea: Instead of picketing, they could shake things up by confronting the psychiatrists with one of their own, a gay psychiatrist. If only they could find someone who would agree to do it. “My first reaction was: No way,” Dr. Fryer recalled. “I had no security, and I did not want to do anything to jeopardize the possibility that I could get a faculty position somewhere. There was no way at that point that I was going to do that as an open thing.” Over the months that followed, though, Ms. Gittings kept calling. She updated Dr. Fryer as she approached a dozen of his gay colleagues and each said no, the risk was too great. Their refusals bothered Dr. Fryer. And Ms. Gittings, as he put it, kept “upping the ante.” What if she paid his way to Dallas? What if he wore a disguise, so that no one knew it was him? “She planted in my mind the possibility that I could do something,” he said. “And that I could do something that would be helpful without ruining my career.” Dr. Fryer’s lover at the time was a drama student, and the two threw themselves into the project of devising a disguise that would conceal his identity: a vastly oversized tuxedo, a rubber mask melted to distort its features, and a wig with a low hairline opposite to his own. Stepping onto the stage that day, Dr. Fryer said, “I felt a great freedom, a great sense of freedom.” There was pride, too, that he was the only one of his colleagues who dared. “To do that thing, to be willing to do that thing, when none of my colleagues in the Gay P.A. would be willing to do it, openly or otherwise,” he said. “They were all in the audience. They were clapping.” The sight of Dr. Fryer had a powerful emotional effect on the psychiatrists gathered in the room, said Dr. Saul Levin, who in 2013 became the first openly gay man to serve as the A.P.A.’s chief executive and medical director. “It obviously really shook them,” he said. “Here was this huge audience for the time, seeing someone come out in a very weird costume. It made them a little disoriented — what the hell is going on here? And then this person comes out with such an eloquent speech.” Dr. Fryer was giddy as he left the stage, so exhilarated that, before returning to Philadelphia, he splurged on a manual harpsichord, which he wryly described as “among the least wise choices of my life.” As he returned to his hotel room to change out of his disguise, he passed the chairman of the psychiatry department at the University of Pennsylvania, who had fired him from his residency. Neither man showed any sign of recognition. Dr. Fryer returned to the rambling, Victorian house where he lived in Germantown with his Doberman pinschers and the medical students he took in as boarders. He remained himself — by turns generous and overbearing, charismatic and acerbic, switching on his Kentucky accent when it suited him. He still didn’t have tenure, and his career path was as tenuous as ever. In 1973, the A.P.A. voted to declassify homosexuality. And Dr. Fryer lost another job, this one at Friends Hospital. Again, an administrator called him into his office. “If you were gay and not flamboyant, we would keep you,” Dr. Fryer recalled him saying. “If you were flamboyant and not gay, we would keep you. But since you are both gay and flamboyant, we cannot keep you.” Dr. Fryer watched as his colleagues got promoted and won tenure. The Gay P.A. faded, as a new, more activist generation stepped forward as an open force within psychiatry, forming the Association of Gay and Lesbian Psychiatrists. But Dr. Fryer took no part in it. “I ran away again,” he said. “I didn’t go to the meetings. It was like I just sort of disappeared.” It was as if, he said, “I had done my thing and it was over for me.” Every now and then, he would tell someone about what he had done. Dr. Karen Kelly, 67, who rented a room from Dr. Fryer as a medical student, said he told her over dinner some time in the late 1970s, and never mentioned it again. Ms. Lollis, 85, said she and Dr. Fryer confided in one another later in life, sometimes speaking on the phone several times a week. But she didn’t find out that he was Dr. Anonymous until 2002, when he sent her the episode of “This American Life” that described the speech. “He just didn’t share it with anyone,” she said. “Not his mother, not his sister.” Dr. Fryer would eventually get tenure at Temple University, where he built a specialty in bereavement and helped pioneer the hospice movement. After teaching all day and having dinner, he would often see patients until 11 p.m., Dr. Kelly recalled. He sat with many of his patients while they were dying. He threw big parties, and sometimes his famous friends, like the anthropologist Margaret Mead or the writer Gail Sheehy, would show up. He wore dashikis. Traveling for conferences, “he’d end up in a tiki restaurant with my cousins, dancing with the hula dancer,” Dr. Kelly said. But a sense of resentment clung to him, said Dr. David Scasta, who got to know Dr. Fryer as a medical resident at Temple University and interviewed him about his life in 2002. He felt isolated from the gay community, said Dr. Scasta, a past president of the Association of Gay and Lesbian Psychiatrists. He never had a long-term relationship. And he always felt that his career was not what it could have been. “There was always a sense of sadness at not being fully accepted,” he said. “John always felt he was on the fringe.” Decades would pass before historians of gay rights fully understood the significance of the Dr. Anonymous speech, that it had “a Stonewall riots kind of importance,” Dr. Scasta added. In that case, too, the surge of forward motion was driven by unlikely people. “It’s not always the law-abiding, nice people who did it, it’s the ones who are on the periphery who can make change,” he said. On Monday, the 50th anniversary of the Dr. Anonymous speech was celebrated with speeches and proclamations in Philadelphia, which declared May 2 John Fryer Day. Public celebration of his act had already begun in the years before Dr. Fryer’s death, and in 2001 he remarked on it caustically, saying he “sort of was trundled out as an exhibit every time someone wanted an exhibit.” At the time, though, it was secrecy that gave his act its power, he said. “As this person who was in disguise, I could say whatever I wanted,” he said, adding, “I did this one isolated event, which changed my life, which helped change the culture in my profession, and I disappeared.” Audio produced by Adrienne Hurst .","hear audio stories publications york times download

"Is the Dirty Shirley the Drink of the Summer?","It’s easy to track the movement of a Dirty Shirley at a bar: Look for a tall glass of Sprite with a gradient of bright red grenadine and a maraschino cherry floating on top. The flavor profile — syrupy, verging on sickly sweet. “It’s going to be a volcanic summer of Dirty Shirleys,” said Ashwin Deshmukh, a founder of Short Stories, a popular (and very pink) bar on the Bowery. He was calling from the SoHo bar, Fanelli Cafe, where the Dirty Shirley is his go-to drink. “My friends are sitting outside right now,” he said, “and I bet if I send them a round of Dirty Shirleys, the entire outside would start ordering them.” The Shirley Temple, named after the child star (who denied involvement in its invention), has been a favorite drink order for kids since the 1930s. In the hands of adults, though, the concoctions are being made “dirty” with a shot of vodka. The outdoor seating area at Fanelli Cafe provides one case study, but the drink’s popularity reaches far beyond the intersection of Prince and Mercer Streets. One Dirty Shirley demo on TikTok has 6.4 million views, and, in other videos, the drink has been memed, mocked, riffed on and, in one case, dubbed “the new espresso martini,” which was the summer drink of 2021. Mr. Deshmukh, 37, said he has an “elaborate, psychographic theory” about the proliferation of the drink. At the beginning of the pandemic, he said, “millennials couldn’t deal with, like, two and a half days of bars being shut down in the city, and moved to all the suburban towns they’re from originally. I really believe it’s the drink of the summer in New York City because everyone’s back and they’re bringing their post-suburban ironic taste with them.” One such person is Tiff Baira, 25, a TikTok influencer with 4.6 million cumulative likes on her New York nightlife and dating videos. Ms. Baira’s experience points to the ’burbs-to-Bushwick provenance of the drink. “A lot of us were put into these weird situations,” said Ms. Baira, who moved home to New Orleans for part of the pandemic, “where you’re an adult, but you’re forced to be a child again.” Upon her return to New York, Ms. Baira was still craving the nostalgic treats of her childhood. She has recently ordered Dirty Shirleys at 169 Bar in Chinatown, Baby’s All Right in Williamsburg, Paul’s Baby Grand in TriBeCa and, most notably, at a friend’s birthday party at Olive Garden in Times Square. “It was Dirty Shirleys all around,” she said. There’s been a notable influx of new restaurants in New York that evoke the feeling of chain restaurants and suburban living (even as creative new spots are opening in the actual suburbs). Plenty of coverage focuses on the dishes served at such places, like the blooming onions at Cozy Royale in Williamsburg and Patti Ann’s in Prospect Heights, and the mozzarella sticks at Bernie’s in Greenpoint. For 20-somethings like Ms. Baira, the suburban chain restaurant aesthetic is evocative of the early 2000s, a period that is also being celebrated this year in fashion (a look colloquially known as “indie sleaze”). And just as the espresso martini rose in popularity last summer along with chokers, slip dresses and plaid, the Dirty Shirley echoes the Juicy Couture, hot pink, low-rise post-Y2K aesthetic. When you’re ordering one, Ms. Baira said, “you feel like Paris Hilton might get that.” The Dirty Shirley’s saccharine nature is at odds with the colorless, low-cal drink orders dominating bar tabs today, which is why Carlos Quirarte, an owner of Ray’s on the Lower East Side, is excited to see the influx of requests. “There’s been this trend for so long of flavorless drinks,” he said. “I get tired of seeing everybody order vodka sodas.” After two years of a pandemic, the Dirty Shirley gives drinkers the go-ahead to embrace the colorful and over-the-top. “The Dirty Shirley is like, ‘Let’s have fun!’ It’s about freedom, it’s about being a kid again,” said Ms. Baira, adding that it’s just what “we need this summer.” Recipes: Dirty Shirley | Shirley Temple Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.

"Karine Jean-Pierre Is Named White House Press Secretary","WASHINGTON — President Biden on Thursday selected Karine Jean-Pierre, the principal deputy press secretary, to replace Jen Psaki as the top White House spokeswoman, making her the first Black woman to hold one of the most high-profile jobs in American politics. Ms. Jean-Pierre, who worked on Mr. Biden’s campaign and has had a long career in Democratic communications, will become the president’s second White House press secretary. In her new role, she will have the high-pressure job of delivering daily briefings from the lectern in the briefing room. In a statement, Mr. Biden said Ms. Jean-Pierre “not only brings the experience, talent and integrity needed for this difficult job, but she will continue to lead the way in communicating about the work of the Biden-Harris administration on behalf of the American people.” He predicted that she would be “a strong voice speaking for me and this administration.” Ms. Psaki’s last day as press secretary will be May 13. She is expected to take an on-air role with MSNBC. “I’m going to cry,” Ms. Psaki said on Thursday before turning to the row of seats where Ms. Jean-Pierre usually observes the news briefing and waving for her to come to the lectern. After noting that her successor will be the first Black woman and openly gay person to serve as press secretary, Ms. Psaki said that Ms. Jean-Pierre “will give a voice to so many.” Ms. Jean-Pierre, 44, will face the challenge of conveying the administration’s message ahead of midterm elections that are expected to pose a significant challenge for Democrats. Mr. Biden’s team has acknowledged that administration officials have struggled to traverse the country and speak to the public during the pandemic, and the president himself has said he should be traveling more and talking to voters about his priorities. Mr. Biden has added other communications veterans to his team recently. Ian Sams, who had been a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, has joined the White House staff as a spokesman for the counsel’s office. And Anita Dunn, a top Biden adviser during his campaign and early in his presidency, will leave the political consulting firm SKDK and rejoin the administration as a senior adviser to Mr. Biden. Ms. Jean-Pierre has taken the lectern in the White House briefing room on a few occasions; last May, she became the first Black woman in decades to address reporters on behalf of the president in the briefing room. Her more frequent formal interactions with the news media came aboard Air Force One, where she often delivered news briefings during Mr. Biden’s trips. But the sense of history being made was not lost on members of the White House press team or reporters attending a news briefing on Thursday that displayed both celebrations of representation and the polarizing issues dividing the country. The briefing shifted among emotional tributes, a presentation of seized Russian yachts, inspiring messages and shouted questions about Mr. Biden’s stance on abortion. Asked about the historic nature of her promotion, Ms. Jean-Pierre responded, “It’s not lost on me.” “I understand how important it is for so many people out there, so many different communities,” she said. “That I stand on their shoulders, and I have been throughout my career.” Ms. Jean-Pierre said she thought it was important for young Black children to see someone who looks like them behind the presidential lectern. “Follow your passion, follow what you believe in and just keep that focus,” she said. Mr. Biden called Ms. Jean-Pierre into the Oval Office on Thursday afternoon to formally offer her the position, according to a White House official. The press team celebrated by drinking warm champagne in Styrofoam cups bearing the presidential seal, the official said. Before stepping down from the lectern, Ms. Jean-Pierre was asked if she ever doubted that she would be able to attain the position of press secretary as a Black woman. “No, not at all,” she said. “Just worked hard towards it. But I understand how hard it is. I do.”","washington president biden thursday selected karine jean pierre principal deputy press secretary replace jen psaki top white house spokeswoman black woman hold profile jobs american politics ms jean pierre biden campaign career democratic communications president white house press secretary role pressure job delivering daily briefings lectern briefing statement biden ms jean pierre brings experience talent integrity difficult job continue lead communicating biden harris administration behalf american people predicted strong voice speaking administration ms psaki day press secretary expected air role msnbc cry ms psaki thursday row seats ms jean pierre observes news briefing waving lectern noting successor black woman openly gay person serve press secretary ms psaki ms jean pierre voice ms jean pierre challenge conveying administration message ahead midterm elections expected pose significant challenge democrats biden team acknowledged administration officials struggled traverse country speak public pandemic president traveling talking voters priorities biden added communications veterans team recently ian sams spokesman department health human services joined white house staff spokesman counsel office anita dunn top biden adviser campaign presidency leave political consulting firm skdk rejoin administration senior adviser biden ms jean pierre lectern white house briefing occasions black woman decades address reporters behalf president briefing frequent formal interactions news media aboard air force delivered news briefings biden trips sense history lost white house press team reporters attending news briefing thursday displayed celebrations representation polarizing issues dividing country briefing shifted emotional tributes presentation seized russian yachts inspiring messages shouted questions biden stance abortion historic nature promotion ms jean pierre responded lost understand people communities stand shoulders career ms jean pierre black children presidential lectern follow passion follow focus biden called ms jean pierre oval office thursday afternoon formally offer position white house official press team celebrated drinking warm champagne styrofoam cups bearing presidential seal official stepping lectern ms jean pierre doubted attain position press secretary black woman hard understand hard"
"Much Gilt, Little Guilt","When “Gilded Glamour,” the dress code of the 2022 Met Gala, was announced, it seemed to be either a recipe for extravagant disaster or irony. After all, the current era has often been compared to the late 19th-century Gilded Age, that period between 1870 and 1900 when extreme wealth was concentrated in the hands of the very few, the robber barons came to the fore, and income inequality grew ever greater just beneath the gold veneer on the glittering surface. That first gilded age came to a symbolic end with a famously ostentatious party, the Bradley-Martin Ball of 1897, in which many of the attendees, the good and great and greedy of New York society, dressed in full swag as Marie Antoinette. Also, Queen Louise of Prussia. Was this really what the organizers were going for? Or could it be, went one interpretation, that by evoking just such a moment, the orchestrators of the current famously ostentatious Met Gala were suggesting that guests dial it back, rewrite history, exercise some restraint. Stop dressing as if for a costume ball in which the goal is to out-Instagram one another. Yeah, right. That idea was blown off the table as soon as Blake Lively, a co-host, appeared in a gleaming copper Versace column festooned in swathes of bustled silk that later unfurled into a verdigris-toned train embroidered with the constellations of Grand Central Terminal. It was a medley of skyscraper dreams rolled into one magic morphing dress. Along with the gown she wore matching opera gloves and a tiara like the Statue of Liberty. Next to her, her husband (and co-host), Ryan Reynolds, in classic white tie, faded into oblivion. It set the tone for the night. Those who played it understated simply got lost in the excess. Even Elon Musk, richest man in the world, harbinger of the current gilded age, Twitter disrupter, doing his best to suggest a responsible steward of a public utility in his white tie and tails, barely made a ripple. There was just so much to see. There was gold — gilt apparently without the guilt. (Of course; no one said interpretations of the theme had to be subtle.) So there was Cardi B, draped in more than a kilometer of body-conscious Versace chains and jewelry, and here was Megan Thee Stallion in gleaming feathers and brocade, like a 24-karat Moschino Valkyrie. There was Carey Mulligan, whose Schiaparelli bustier and train were embroidered with 79,000 gold sequins; and here was Chloe Bailey, whose metallic, strapless Area column recreated the exaggerated curves and hips of a corset and pannier without resorting to those body-shaping devices. Though lots of others did. Corsets were the accessory of the evening, along with capes, opera gloves (best on Kodi Smit-McPhee, who paired his red Bottega Veneta pair with a white tuxedo shirt and “jeans” made of leather), tiaras (Hamish Bowles wore a Verdura crown last seen in 1957 at Buckingham Palace) and trains. In the waist-cinching stakes, the tightest statement may have been made by Billie Eilish as a sort of Gothic bordello madam in bustled Gucci satin and green lace — all upcycled from fabrics in the atelier. Lenny Kravitz, in leather and lace, Paloma Elsesser in a white Coach number, and Evan Mock in ice cream tones and a white neck ruff by Head of State, like a sorbet Little Lord Fauntleroy, came close. Feathers were also a trend, on the honorary co-chair Anna Wintour (in Chanel), Nicola Coughlan (in Richard Quinn) and, in two relatively subtle looks, Emma Stone in a white Louis Vuitton slip dress and Hailey Bieber in white Saint Laurent. They were the evening’s palate cleansers, the yin to the yang of the peekaboo black dresses with strategically placed period detailing of Vanessa Hudgens in Moschino, Phoebe Dynevor in Louis Vuitton and Precious Lee in Altuzarra wearing (yes) another corset. They were a reminder that, in fact, sometimes less is actually more, on an evening of rapacious ruffles seemingly dedicated to the opposite idea. A reminder of a different sort came courtesy of Riz Ahmed, who said in a Vogue interview on the red carpet that his unbuttoned silk workwear shirt, tank top and trousers tucked into knee-high boots were “a homage to the immigrant workers that kept the Gilded Age going.” The outfit was by 4SDesigns, but that the accompanying chain around his neck was an 18-karat white gold, platinum, chalcedony, turquoise and diamond necklace by Cartier somewhat complicated the point. Less so Questlove, wearing a quilt by the Gee’s Bend quilters under his Zegna coat to represent “Black women who had sacrificed for their country.” Because, he said, “for African Americans in this country the gilded period’s a little bit different.” They weren’t the only ones to try to add layers, at least conceptually, to their outfits. Hillary Clinton, attending the gala for the first time in two decades, wore a burgundy Altuzarra gown with the names of 60 American women who had inspired her embroidered on the hem, including Abigail Adams, Clara Barton, Rosa Parks — and her mother, Dorothy Rodham. And Mayor Eric Adams of New York, whose decision to attend the gala was not without controversy given the state of the city, modeled a tailcoat by Laolu Senbanjo with the message “End Gun Violence,” as well as M.T.A. and other metropolitan symbols on the back and lapels. As it happened, the city — or rather its skyline — was also the inspiration for Alicia Keys’s sparkling Ralph Lauren column and cape, which had the soaring silhouettes of the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building picked out in silver on the hem, a nod to the equally soaring ambitions of the industrialists whose dicey legacy built this town. Ditto Kaia Gerber’s steel-silver Alexander McQueen, though the ripples of the Titian hair she wore with it evoked Lady Godiva even more than architecture. Still, when it came to channeling history, Kim Kardashian, making the final entrance of the evening with Pete Davidson, topped them all. Not just because she managed to shoehorn herself into Marilyn Monroe’s famous “Happy Birthday, Mr. President” nude dress — literally, the same one, which Ms. Kardashian wore to climb the steps, immediately swapping it for a copy in order to move on to dinner. Not just because for the first time the entire Kardashian female clan had been invited. It was because, in receiving the honor of being the last to arrive, she, a pop culture figure born of reality TV who had once been barred from the gala guest list, conclusively demonstrated that it is influence and fame, not just pedigree and filthy lucre, that are the real currency of success; the keys that unlock the doors of even the most exclusive events. Today, even more than in the original Gilded Age.","gilded glamour dress code met gala announced recipe extravagant disaster irony current era compared late th century gilded age period extreme wealth concentrated hands robber barons fore income inequality grew beneath gold veneer glittering surface gilded age symbolic famously ostentatious party bradley martin ball attendees greedy york society dressed swag marie antoinette queen louise prussia organizers interpretation evoking moment orchestrators current famously ostentatious met gala suggesting guests dial rewrite history exercise restraint stop dressing costume ball goal instagram yeah idea blown table blake lively host appeared gleaming copper versace column festooned swathes bustled silk unfurled verdigris toned train embroidered constellations grand central terminal medley skyscraper dreams rolled magic morphing dress gown wore matching opera gloves tiara statue liberty husband host ryan reynolds classic white tie faded oblivion set tone night played understated simply lost excess elon musk richest world harbinger current gilded age twitter disrupter suggest responsible steward public utility white tie tails barely ripple gold gilt apparently guilt interpretations theme subtle cardi draped kilometer body conscious versace chains jewelry megan thee stallion gleaming feathers brocade karat moschino valkyrie carey mulligan schiaparelli bustier train embroidered gold sequins chloe bailey metallic strapless column recreated exaggerated curves hips corset pannier resorting body shaping devices lots corsets accessory evening capes opera gloves kodi smit mcphee paired red bottega veneta pair white tuxedo shirt jeans leather tiaras hamish bowles wore verdura crown buckingham palace trains waist cinching stakes tightest statement billie eilish sort gothic bordello madam bustled gucci satin green lace upcycled fabrics atelier lenny kravitz leather lace paloma elsesser white coach evan mock ice cream tones white neck ruff head sorbet lord fauntleroy close feathers trend honorary chair anna wintour chanel nicola coughlan richard quinn subtle emma stone white louis vuitton slip dress hailey bieber white saint laurent evening palate cleansers yin yang peekaboo black dresses strategically period detailing vanessa hudgens moschino phoebe dynevor louis vuitton precious lee altuzarra wearing corset reminder evening rapacious ruffles seemingly dedicated opposite idea reminder sort courtesy riz ahmed vogue interview red carpet unbuttoned silk workwear shirt tank top trousers tucked knee boots homage immigrant workers gilded age outfit sdesigns accompanying chain neck karat white gold platinum chalcedony turquoise diamond necklace cartier complicated questlove wearing quilt gee bend quilters zegna coat represent black women sacrificed country african americans country gilded period bit weren add layers conceptually outfits hillary clinton attending gala time decades wore burgundy altuzarra gown names american women inspired embroidered hem including abigail adams clara barton rosa parks mother dorothy rodham mayor eric adams york decision attend gala controversy city modeled tailcoat laolu senbanjo message gun violence metropolitan symbols lapels happened city skyline inspiration alicia keys sparkling ralph lauren column cape soaring silhouettes empire building chrysler building picked silver hem nod equally soaring ambitions industrialists dicey legacy built town ditto kaia gerber steel silver alexander mcqueen ripples titian hair wore evoked lady godiva architecture channeling history kim kardashian final entrance evening pete davidson topped managed shoehorn marilyn monroe famous happy birthday president nude dress literally ms kardashian wore climb steps immediately swapping copy move dinner time entire kardashian female clan invited receiving honor arrive pop culture figure born reality tv barred gala guest list conclusively demonstrated influence fame pedigree filthy lucre real currency success keys unlock doors exclusive events original gilded age"
"Once Close Allies, Roberts and Alito Have Taken Divergent Paths","WASHINGTON — There was a time when Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., the author of the leaked draft opinion on abortion that rocked the nation on Monday night, was Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.’s closest ally on the Supreme Court. The two men are both products of the conservative legal movement, and they were named to the court by President George W. Bush within months of each other. Their voting records were initially indistinguishable. Indeed, when the chief justice had a particularly difficult case, he would often assign the majority opinion to Justice Alito. “For their first decade on the court together, the chief clearly generally viewed Justice Alito as a colleague upon whom he could rely to craft the kind of narrowly reasoned opinions for the court necessary to maintain a bare five-justice majority,” said Richard J. Lazarus, a law professor at Harvard. “And the chief rewarded Alito with prime opinion assignments in some of the court’s biggest cases, notwithstanding Alito’s formal status as a junior justice.” But the dynamics and alliances at the court have shifted, especially after the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and her replacement by Justice Amy Coney Barrett. Once partners, Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito are now emblems of a stark divide at the court as it confronts a crucial choice: whether to eliminate the constitutional right to abortion entirely in a case challenging a Mississippi law that bans the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy. “Justice Alito now appears to have concluded he no longer needs the chief to receive coveted opinion assignments,” Professor Lazarus said. “And, buoyed by a five-justice conservative majority to the right of the chief, Justice Alito has apparently concluded, as underscored by his first draft opinion in the Mississippi abortion case, that he can now swing for the fences using the broadest language possible.” The two men have been moving in different directions for years, said Lee Epstein, a law professor and political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis. “They initially marched in ideological lock step, seemingly trusted allies,” she said. “But over time Roberts drifted to the left and Alito drifted way to the right, leaving a gaping hole between them.” That gaping hole grew into a chasm in the case challenging Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion. Chief Justice Roberts, an institutionalist committed to an incremental approach, has signaled that he wants to limit Roe’s reach without destroying it in a single blow. Justice Alito, based on his draft opinion, wants to reduce Roe to rubble. What accounts for the schism? It is partly a matter of temperament. Chief Justice Roberts is witty, canny and controlled. Justice Alito can be awkward and aggrieved, although he is capable of wry and rueful humor.

Martin, Washington University in St. Louis, and Kevin Quinn, University of Michigan. The two men also differ in their sense of urgency. Chief Justice Roberts is 67, which is young by Supreme Court standards. He is committed to playing the long game. Justice Alito, 72, is not much older, but he is done waiting. Following the arrival of Justice Barrett in 2020, he is now part of an impatient group of five conservative justices to the chief justice’s right. Their power may ebb over time, as the recent hospitalization of Justice Clarence Thomas, 73, must have reminded them. But the most important difference between Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito is in their titles and what they imply. A thought experiment helps illuminate the point. Chief Justice Roberts was initially nominated to replace Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, who announced in July 2005 that she planned to retire. Two months later, as the confirmation hearings were approaching, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist died. Mr. Bush then nominated Chief Justice Roberts to his current position. If not for that switch, Chief Justice Roberts would have been one of eight associate justices and, in all probability, a reliable conservative member of the court. As the head of the judicial branch, though, Chief Justice Roberts views himself as having broader responsibilities, notably in guarding the independence and authority of the court. The chief justice’s confirmation hearings were a triumph. Justice Alito, by contrast, felt bruised by some of the questions at his own confirmation hearings. His wife, Martha-Ann, left the hearing room in tears when Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, defended Justice Alito from the charge that his membership in an alumni group was evidence of bigotry. Nor was Justice Alito pleased when President Barack Obama criticized the court’s Citizens United campaign finance decision at the State of the Union address in 2010, with six justices present. Justice Alito responded by mouthing the words “not true.” He has not attended another State of the Union address. Chief Justice Roberts makes a point of going. Even now, Chief Justice Roberts certainly leans right. On issues of racial discrimination, religion, voting and campaign finance, his views are squarely in the mainstream of conservative legal thinking. But he also views himself as the custodian of the court’s legitimacy. He has issued statements, for instance, rebuking President Donald J. Trump and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, for attacks on members of the federal judiciary. What is Roe v. Wade? Roe v. Wade is a landmark Supreme court decision that legalized abortion across the United States. The 7-2 ruling was announced on Jan. 22, 1973. Justice Harry A. Blackmun, a modest Midwestern Republican and a defender of the right to abortion, wrote the majority opinion. What was the case about? The ruling struck down laws in many states that had barred abortion, declaring that they could not ban the procedure before the point at which a fetus can survive outside the womb. That point, known as fetal viability, was around 28 weeks when Roe was decided. Today, most experts estimate it to be about 23 or 24 weeks. What else did the case do? Roe v. Wade created a framework to govern abortion regulation based on the trimesters of pregnancy. In the first trimester, it allowed almost no regulations. In the second, it allowed regulations to protect women’s health. In the third, it allowed states to ban abortions so long as exceptions were made to protect the life and health of the mother. In 1992, the court tossed that framework, while affirming Roe’s essential holding. What would happen if Roe were overturned? Individual states would be able to decide whether and when abortions would be legal. The practice would likely be banned or restricted heavily in about half of them, but many would continue to allow it. Thirteen states have so-called trigger laws, which would immediately make abortion illegal if Roe were overturned. Conservatives grew wary of Chief Justice Roberts when he cast the decisive vote in 2012 to uphold a central provision of the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Obama’s signature legislative achievement. Justice Alito joined a caustic dissent. But aside from that decision and a 2015 sequel, the conservative case against the chief justice was for many years weak. That changed in the Trump era, when Chief Justice Roberts voted with what was then the court’s four-member liberal wing in cases concerning abortion, young immigrants known as Dreamers and adding a question on citizenship to the census. Justice Alito was on the other side in all of those cases. The chief justice was also in the majority in 5-to-4 decisions early in the pandemic upholding restrictions on gatherings at houses of worship. Justice Alito, in a 2020 speech to the Federalist Society, the conservative legal group, was harshly critical of those decisions. In one, concerning restrictions in Nevada, he said the court had allowed the state to treat houses of worship less favorably than it did casinos. “Deciding whether to allow this disparate treatment should not have been a very tough call,” Justice Alito said. “Take a quick look at the Constitution. You will see the free-exercise clause of the First Amendment, which protects religious liberty. You will not find a craps clause, or a blackjack clause, or a slot machine clause.” After the arrival of Justice Barrett fundamentally changed the direction of the court, the justices started striking down such restrictions by 5-to-4 votes, with Justice Alito now in the majority and the chief justice on the losing side. In his speech to the Federalist Society, Justice Alito seemed to take sides in the culture wars, recalling the days when the comedian George Carlin’s “seven dirty words” were not heard on television. “Today you can see shows on your TV screen in which the dialogue appears at times to consist almost entirely of those words,” Justice Alito said. “Carlin’s list seems like a quaint relic.” “But it would be easy to put together a new list called ‘things you can’t say if you are a student or a professor at a college or university or an employee of many big corporations,’” he said. “And there wouldn’t be just seven items on that list. Seventy times seven would be closer to the mark.” A prime example, Justice Alito said, was opposition to same-sex marriage. “You can’t say that marriage is a union between one man and one woman,” he said. “Until very recently that’s what the vast majority of Americans thought. Now it’s considered bigotry.” Chief Justice Roberts is not in the habit of making politically charged speeches to the Federalist Society or of airing grievances about where society is heading. Like Justice Alito, Chief Justice Roberts dissented from the 2015 decision establishing a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. But five years later, the chief justice voted with the majority in a ruling that said a landmark civil rights law protects gay and transgender employees from workplace discrimination. Justice Alito dissented.","washington time justice samuel alito jr author leaked draft opinion abortion rocked nation monday night chief justice john roberts jr closest ally supreme court products

"The History of Cinco de Mayo and How It’s Celebrated","More than being an excuse to treat oneself to nachos, tacos, mezcal and margaritas, Cinco de Mayo has a history that runs deep and continues to serve as a vehicle conveying Mexican culture, pride and values. Here are a few things to know about the day: Cinco de Mayo commemorates Mexico’s unexpected victory over France in the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862. The conflict between the two countries had begun in 1861, after Benito Juárez, then the president of Mexico, suspended the nation’s foreign debt payments, and Napoleon III responded by sending French troops to invade. The victory in Puebla galvanized the Mexican forces but turned out to be short-lived, and France later occupied the country, installing Maximilian I as emperor. Not until 1867 did the new Mexican Republic finally expel the French, execute Maximilian I and regain control of the country. Cinco de Mayo literally means “May 5” in Spanish, which is when this celebration of Mexican heritage falls each year. The day, mostly commemorated by Mexican Americans north of the U.S. border, is also celebrated in Puebla, the town and region southeast of Mexico City, where the holiday originated. No. Cinco de Mayo is often mistaken for Mexico’s Independence Day in the United States, but Mexican independence is actually celebrated on Sept. 16. On that day, in 1810, a priest named Miguel Hidalgo called upon the Mexican people to revolt against the rule of Spain, eventually leading to the War for Independence, which ended in 1821. Jessica Lavariega Monforti, the vice provost at California State University, Channel Islands, said that Cinco de Mayo had been celebrated in California every year since its inception in 1863. In that first year, Mexicans and Americans in the state came together to mark the anniversary of the Battle of Puebla and use it to raise money and recruit men to aid those still fighting under the leadership of Juárez against the French. Those early celebrations, Dr. Lavariega Monforti said, were mostly about fighting for democracy and freedom against white supremacists and other oppressors — both in Mexico and in Civil War-era California, where Latinos mostly favored a Union victory over the Confederacy. Cinco de Mayo continued to be celebrated in the United States, largely thanks to the efforts of those of Mexican descent. Jeffrey M. Pilcher, a professor of history at the University of Toronto, said followers of the dictator Porfirio Díaz, who ruled Mexico intermittently between 1876 and 1911, and had been a general in the Battle of Puebla, continued to celebrate Cinco de Mayo while living in exile in the American south. The celebration gradually became a festival for Mexicans and Mexican Americans across the country, as well as part of a developing Mexican-American civil rights movement that started in the 1940s. Many activists started pointing to Cinco de Mayo as a source of pride, Dr. Lavariega Monforti said. Over time, however, that message of cultural pride seemed to get lost. Mr. Pilcher said that Cinco de Mayo began to take off in the United States in the 1970s and ’80s, when brewing companies began capitalizing on it as a way to appeal to consumers amid the rising popularity of Mexican restaurants. “By the 1990s, most of the public discourse about the day had been refocused on it as a time to consume imported beer, tequila and Mexican food,” Dr. Lavariega Monforti said. In Mexico, the festivity is marked in the state of Puebla with historical re-enactments of the Battle of Puebla, parades, mariachi music, colorful costumes and fireworks. “For many Mexicans, however, May 5 is a day like any other. It is not a federal holiday, so offices, banks and stores remain open,” said Dr. Lavariega Monforti. Celebrations are more visible in the United States. Dr. Lavariega Monforti said that some communities in the United States, especially those with roots in the Puebla region, have attempted to reclaim the celebration as their own in recent years. These efforts are mostly visible in larger cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago, where events are dedicated to the celebrations of dance, literature and food from Puebla. In New York City, some Mexican folkloric troupes are also treating Cinco de Mayo as an opportunity to direct attention to the historic events and culture of the Puebla region. “It seems that these efforts are direct responses to the consumerism surrounding Cinco de Mayo, and the commercialization of Latino culture in the United States,” Dr. Lavariega Monforti said. U.S. presidents traditionally mark the occasion, too. President Biden and Jill Biden, the first lady, will host a Cinco de Mayo reception in the Rose Garden on Thursday, which will also be attended by Beatriz Gutierrez Muller, the first lady of Mexico. There is no Mexican dish associated with the festivity, Mr. Pilcher explained, but it can still be an occasion to gather and honor Mexico’s, and Puebla’s own, culinary traditions. Pedro Reyes, a Mexican food writer and creative director at Paladar, a Mexican company devoted to the development of culinary projects, said that mole poblano, the chocolate-rich version of mole that originated in Puebla, might be a good pick for a Cinco de Mayo-inspired feast. He suggested pairing the dish with chalupas, small fried tortillas enjoyed with a variety of fillings; white rice; nopales salad; fried beans; and molotes de plátano, stuffed plantain patties. Besides beer and tequila, beverages could include agua fresca, a light fruit drink in flavors like hibiscus, horchata and tamarind, as well as pulque, a fermented alcoholic drink. And please, keep your peas as far as you can from your avocados, at least on this occasion. “I mean, don’t get me wrong, I like them, I can eat them,” Mr. Reyes said. “But where’s the need to mess with my guacamole?”","excuse treat oneself nachos tacos mezcal margaritas cinco de mayo history runs deep continues serve vehicle conveying mexican culture pride values day cinco de mayo commemorates mexico unexpected victory france battle puebla conflict countries begun benito juárez president mexico suspended nation foreign debt payments napoleon iii responded sending french troops invade victory puebla galvanized mexican forces short lived france occupied country installing maximilian emperor mexican republic finally expel french execute maximilian regain control country cinco de mayo literally means spanish celebration mexican heritage falls day commemorated mexican americans north border celebrated puebla town region southeast mexico city holiday originated cinco de mayo mistaken mexico independence day united mexican independence celebrated sept day priest named miguel hidalgo called mexican people revolt rule spain eventually leading war independence jessica lavariega monforti vice provost california university channel islands cinco de mayo celebrated california inception mexicans americans mark anniversary battle puebla raise money recruit aid fighting leadership juárez french celebrations dr lavariega monforti fighting democracy freedom white supremacists oppressors mexico civil war era california latinos favored union victory confederacy cinco de mayo continued celebrated united efforts mexican descent jeffrey pilcher professor history university toronto followers dictator porfirio díaz ruled mexico intermittently battle puebla continued celebrate cinco de mayo living exile american south celebration gradually festival mexicans mexican americans country developing mexican american civil rights movement started activists started cinco de mayo source pride dr lavariega monforti time message cultural pride lost pilcher cinco de mayo united s brewing companies capitalizing appeal consumers amid rising popularity mexican restaurants public discourse day refocused time consume imported beer tequila mexican food dr lavariega monforti mexico festivity marked puebla historical enactments battle puebla parades mariachi music colorful costumes fireworks mexicans day federal holiday offices banks stores remain dr lavariega monforti celebrations visible united dr lavariega monforti communities united roots puebla region attempted reclaim celebration recent efforts visible larger cities los angeles san francisco chicago events dedicated celebrations dance literature food puebla york city mexican folkloric troupes treating cinco de mayo opportunity direct attention historic events culture puebla region efforts direct responses consumerism surrounding cinco de mayo commercialization latino culture united dr lavariega monforti presidents traditionally mark occasion president biden jill biden lady host cinco de mayo reception rose garden thursday attended beatriz gutierrez muller lady mexico mexican dish festivity pilcher explained occasion gather honor mexico puebla culinary traditions pedro reyes mexican food writer creative director paladar mexican company devoted development culinary projects mole poblano chocolate rich version mole originated puebla pick cinco de mayo inspired feast suggested pairing dish chalupas fried tortillas enjoyed variety fillings white rice nopales salad fried beans molotes de plátano stuffed plantain patties beer tequila beverages include agua fresca light fruit drink flavors hibiscus horchata tamarind pulque fermented alcoholic drink peas avocados occasion don wrong eat reyes mess guacamole"
"Trump Proposed Launching Missiles Into Mexico to ‘Destroy the Drug Labs,’ Esper Says","President Donald J. Trump in 2020 asked Mark T. Esper, his defense secretary, about the possibility of launching missiles into Mexico to “destroy the drug labs” and wipe out the cartels, maintaining that the United States’ involvement in a strike against its southern neighbor could be kept secret, Mr. Esper recounts in his upcoming memoir. Those remarkable discussions were among several moments that Mr. Esper described in the book, “A Sacred Oath,” as leaving him all but speechless when he served the 45th president. Mr. Esper, the last Senate-confirmed defense secretary under Mr. Trump, also had concerns about speculation that the president might misuse the military around Election Day by, for instance, having soldiers seize ballot boxes. He warned subordinates to be on alert for unusual calls from the White House in the lead-up to the election. The book, to be published on Tuesday, offers a stunningly candid perspective from a former defense secretary, and it illuminates key episodes from the Trump presidency, including some that were unknown or underexplored. “I felt like I was writing for history and for the American people,” said Mr. Esper, who underwent the standard Pentagon security clearance process to check for classified information. He also sent his writing to more than two dozen four-star generals, some cabinet members and others to weigh in on accuracy and fairness. Pressed on his view of Mr. Trump, Mr. Esper — who strained throughout the book to be fair to the man who fired him while also calling out his increasingly erratic behavior after his first impeachment trial ended in February 2020 — said carefully but bluntly, “He is an unprincipled person who, given his self-interest, should not be in the position of public service.” A spokesman for Mr. Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Esper describes an administration completely overtaken by concerns about Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign, with every decision tethered to that objective. He writes that he could have resigned, and weighed the idea several times, but that he believed the president was surrounded by so many yes-men and people whispering dangerous ideas to him that a loyalist would have been put in Mr. Esper’s place. The real act of service, he decided, was staying in his post to ensure that such things did not come to pass. One such idea emerged from Mr. Trump, who was unhappy about the constant flow of drugs across the southern border, during the summer of 2020. Mr. Trump asked Mr. Esper at least twice if the military could “shoot missiles into Mexico to destroy the drug labs.” “They don’t have control of their own country,” Mr. Esper recounts Mr. Trump saying. When Mr. Esper raised various objections, Mr. Trump said that “we could just shoot some Patriot missiles and take out the labs, quietly,” adding that “no one would know it was us.” Mr. Trump said he would just say that the United States had not conducted the strike, Mr. Esper recounts, writing that he would have thought it was a joke had he not been staring Mr. Trump in the face. In Mr. Esper’s telling, Mr. Trump seemed more emboldened, and more erratic, after he was acquitted in his first impeachment trial. Mr. Esper writes that personnel choices reflected that reality, as Mr. Trump tried to tighten his grip on the executive branch with demands of personal loyalty. Among Mr. Trump’s desires was to put 10,000 active-duty troops on the streets of Washington on June 1, 2020, after large protests against police brutality erupted following the police killing of George Floyd. Mr. Trump asked Mr. Esper about the demonstrators, “Can’t you just shoot them?” Mr. Esper describes one episode nearly a month earlier during which Mr. Trump, whose re-election prospects were reshaped by his repeated bungling of the response to the coronavirus pandemic, behaved so erratically at a May 9 meeting about China with the Joint Chiefs of Staff that one officer grew alarmed. The unidentified officer confided to Mr. Esper months later that the meeting led him to research the 25th Amendment, under which the vice president and members of the cabinet can remove a president from office, to see what was required and under what circumstances it might be used. Mr. Esper writes that he never believed Mr. Trump’s conduct rose to the level of needing to invoke the 25th Amendment. He also strains to give Mr. Trump credit where he thinks he deserves it. Nonetheless, Mr. Esper paints a portrait of someone not in control of his emotions or his thought process throughout 2020. Mr. Esper singles out officials whom he considered erratic or dangerous influences on Mr. Trump, with the policy adviser Stephen Miller near the top of the list. He recounts that Mr. Miller proposed sending 250,000 troops to the southern border, claiming that a large caravan of migrants was en route. “The U.S. armed forces don’t have 250,000 troops to send to the border for such nonsense,” Mr. Esper writes that he responded. In October 2019, after members of the national security team assembled in the Situation Room to watch a feed of the raid that killed the Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Mr. Miller proposed securing Mr. al-Baghdadi’s head, dipping it in pig’s blood and parading it around to warn other terrorists, Mr. Esper writes. That would be a “war crime,” Mr. Esper shot back. Mr. Miller flatly denied the episode and called Mr. Esper “a moron.” Mr. Esper also viewed Mark Meadows, Mr. Trump’s final White House chief of staff, as a huge problem for the administration and the national security team in particular. Mr. Meadows often threw the president’s name around when barking orders, but Mr. Esper makes clear that he often was not certain whether Mr. Meadows was communicating what Mr. Trump wanted or what Mr. Meadows wanted. He also writes about repeated clashes with Robert C. O’Brien, Mr. Trump’s national security adviser in the final year, describing Mr. O’Brien as advocating a bellicose approach to Iran without considering the potential fallout. Mr. O’Brien said he was “surprised and disappointed” by Mr. Esper’s comments.","president donald trump mark esper defense secretary possibility launching missiles mexico destroy drug labs wipe cartels maintaining united involvement strike southern neighbor secret esper recounts upcoming memoir remarkable discussions moments esper book sacred oath leaving speechless served th president esper senate confirmed defense secretary trump concerns speculation president misuse military election day instance soldiers seize ballot boxes warned subordinates alert unusual calls white house lead election book published tuesday offers stunningly candid perspective defense secretary illuminates key episodes trump presidency including unknown underexplored writing history american people esper underwent standard pentagon security clearance process check classified information writing dozen star generals cabinet weigh accuracy fairness pressed view trump esper strained book fair fired calling increasingly erratic behavior impeachment trial february carefully bluntly unprincipled person position public service spokesman trump immediately respond request comment esper describes administration completely overtaken concerns trump election campaign decision tethered objective writes resigned weighed idea times believed president surrounded people whispering dangerous ideas loyalist esper real act service decided staying post ensure pass idea emerged trump unhappy constant flow drugs southern border summer trump esper military shoot missiles mexico destroy drug labs don control country esper recounts trump esper raised objections trump shoot patriot missiles labs quietly adding trump united conducted strike esper recounts writing joke staring trump esper telling trump emboldened erratic acquitted impeachment trial esper writes personnel choices reflected reality trump tighten grip executive branch demands personal loyalty trump desires active duty troops streets washington june protests police brutality erupted police killing george floyd trump esper demonstrators shoot esper describes episode month earlier trump election prospects reshaped repeated bungling response coronavirus pandemic behaved erratically meeting china joint chiefs staff officer grew alarmed unidentified officer confided esper months meeting led research th amendment vice president cabinet remove president office required circumstances esper writes believed trump conduct rose level invoke th amendment strains trump credit deserves nonetheless esper paints portrait control emotions process esper singles officials considered erratic dangerous influences trump policy adviser stephen miller top list recounts miller proposed sending troops southern border claiming caravan migrants en route armed forces don troops send border nonsense esper writes responded october national security team assembled situation watch feed raid killed islamic leader abu bakr al baghdadi miller proposed securing al baghdadi head dipping pig blood parading warn terrorists esper writes war crime esper shot miller flatly denied episode called esper moron esper viewed mark meadows trump final white house chief staff huge administration national security team meadows threw president barking esper makes meadows communicating trump meadows writes repeated clashes robert brien trump national security adviser final describing brien advocating bellicose approach iran potential fallout brien surprised disappointed esper comments"
"U.S. Intelligence Helped Ukraine Strike Russian Flagship, Officials Say","WASHINGTON — The United States provided intelligence that helped Ukrainian forces locate and strike the flagship of Russia’s Black Sea fleet last month, another sign that the administration is easing its self-imposed limitations on how far it will go in helping Ukraine fight Russia, U.S. officials said. The targeting help, which contributed to the eventual sinking of the flagship, the Moskva, is part of a continuing classified effort by the Biden administration to provide real-time battlefield intelligence to Ukraine. That intelligence also includes sharing anticipated Russian troop movements, gleaned from a recent American assessment of Moscow’s battle plan for the fighting in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, the officials said. The administration has sought to keep much of the battlefield and maritime intelligence it is sharing with the Ukrainians secret out of fear it will be seen as an escalation and provoke President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia into a wider war. But in recent weeks, the United States has sped heavier weapons to Ukraine and requested an extraordinary $33 billion in additional military, economic and humanitarian aid from Congress, demonstrating how quickly American restraints on support for Ukraine are shifting. Two senior American officials said that Ukraine already had obtained the Moskva’s targeting data on its own, and that the United States provided only confirmation. But other officials said the American intelligence was crucial to Ukraine’s sinking of the ship. The U.S. intelligence help to strike the Moskva was reported earlier by NBC News. On April 13, Ukrainian forces on the ground fired two Neptune missiles, striking the Moskva and igniting a fire that eventually led to the sinking of the warship. Attention has also focused on whether the aging ship’s radar systems were working properly. Ukrainian and U.S. officials said the Moskva was possibly distracted by Ukraine’s deploying of a Turkish-made Bayraktar drone nearby. Immediately after the strike, Biden administration officials were scrupulously silent, declining to confirm even that the Moskva had been struck. But in recent days, American officials confirmed that targeting data from American intelligence sources was provided to Ukraine in the hours before the Neptune missiles were launched. The officials declined to elaborate on what specific information was passed along, but one official said the information went beyond simply a report on the ship’s location in the Black Sea, 65 nautical miles south of Odesa. The sinking of the ship was a major blow to Russia and the most significant loss for any navy in 40 years. Russia has denied Ukrainian missiles played any role in the Moskva’s demise, claiming instead that an onboard fire caused a munitions explosion that doomed the ship. Independent Russian news outlets based outside the country have reported that about 40 men died and an additional 100 were injured when the warship was damaged and sank. Biden administration officials have declined to publicly confirm that American intelligence provided the targeting information that allowed Ukraine to hit the Moskva. The Pentagon press secretary, John F. Kirby, asked about a report in The Times of London that a Navy P-8 spy plane from Sigonella air base in Italy was tracking the Moskva before it was hit by Ukraine, spoke of air policing missions in the Black Sea as part of a carefully worded response: “There was no provision of targeting information by any United States Navy P-8 flying in these air policing missions,” he said. An American official said the Ukrainians asked the Americans about a ship sailing in the Black Sea south of Odesa. The United States identified it as the Moskva, and confirmed its location. The Ukrainians then targeted the ship. The Ukrainians carried out the strike without the prior knowledge of the United States. The official said the United States provided confirmation to the Ukrainian military, but other officials said it was not certain Ukraine could have hit the ship without U.S. assistance. After this article was published, Mr. Kirby added in a statement, “The Ukrainians have their own intelligence capabilities to track and target Russian naval vessels, as they did in this case.” American officials have acknowledged publicly that actionable intelligence was provided to the Ukrainians in the run-up to Russia’s invasion on Feb. 24, and that the practice has continued in the weeks since. But these officials have shied away from confirming American involvement in Ukrainian operations that have resulted in the deaths of Russian soldiers. The U.S. assessment of Russia’s war plan for the Donbas region allowed a senior Pentagon official to say last week that Russia appeared to be “several days behind” schedule in its offensive there because of stiff Ukrainian resistance and continuing supply line problems. Russian forces can always deviate from their plans, but American officials said the intelligence allows Ukrainian forces to avoid attack in some locations and position themselves to strike Russians in others. Although the administration remains wary of provoking Mr. Putin to the point that he further escalates his attacks — President Biden has said he will not send American troops to Ukraine or establish a “no-fly zone” there — current and former officials said the administration found some value in warning Russia that Ukraine had the weight of the United States and NATO behind it. Officials said Moscow had its own calculations to weigh, including whether it could handle a bigger war, particularly one that would allow NATO to invoke its mutual defense charter or enter the war more directly. The New York Times reported on Wednesday that American intelligence about Russian movements provided to Ukraine has allowed Kyiv to target and kill a number of Russian generals. On Thursday, Mr. Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, acknowledged intelligence sharing with the Ukrainians but provided few details. Victory Day concerns. Officials across Ukraine issued urgent warnings about the threat of stepped-up Russian missile strikes over the weekend, amid fears that President Vladimir V. Putin might use Russia’s Victory Day holiday on May 9 to intensify attacks and turn what he calls a “special military operation” in Ukraine into explicit, all-out war. In Mariupol. In the ruined city, where fighting continued to rage, an evacuation convoy was dispatched again to the Azovstal steel plant, where about 200 civilians are believed to be trapped underground, along with the last Ukrainian soldiers defending the city. The Russian bombardment of the factory continued overnight. On the ground. Ukrainian soldiers are trying to drive Russian forces back from outside the two strategically important cities of Kharkiv and Izium. Russia appears to have escalated its attempts to trap and destroy Ukrainian units farther south. Russian oil embargo. The European Union unveiled a plan to halt imports of Russian crude oil in the next six months and refined oil products by the end of the year. If approved as expected, it would be the bloc’s biggest and costliest step yet toward ending its own dependence on Russian fossil fuels. But Mr. Kirby said the Ukrainians have their own sources of intelligence, which they combine with others and choose what targets to strike. “They make their own decisions,” Mr. Kirby said. “And they take their own actions.” In an interview on Thursday with CNN, Representative Adam B. Schiff, the California Democrat who leads the House Intelligence Committee, said the Biden administration had been loath to discuss intelligence sharing for fear of saying anything “that will escalate the conflict.” “We are providing real-time intelligence to Ukraine to help it defend itself,” Mr. Schiff said. “I don’t think the administration wants to go into specifics about just what kind of what circumstances, but we want to make sure that Ukraine is successful.” For decades, the Moskva, a potent embodiment of Russian naval power in the Black Sea, bristled with missiles and loomed ominously on the horizon, inspiring awe in those who saw it. But American Navy officials who toured Russian cruisers when there was U.S.-Russian military cooperation in the late 1990s and early 2000s said the Moskva had problems. There was little visible damage control equipment aboard the warship for quickly putting out shipboard fires. The officials said they could not see fire extinguishers or fire hoses in passageways throughout the ships. On American ships, such equipment is stored close at hand to allow the crew to rapidly extinguish fires, which is critical at sea. Russian media reports have said a fire onboard ignited an ammunition magazine, seriously damaging the Moskva. American officials say the Neptune missiles most likely caused the fire, which the crew could not contain before the aging vessel ultimately sank while being towed to port. “The Russian military had long debated whether to retire the Moskva,” said Michael Kofman, the director of Russia studies at CNA, a research institute in Arlington County, Va. “It was an aging Soviet cruiser in dire need of modernization.” But with a shortage of cruisers and destroyers, Moscow ultimately decided to extend its service. It was the Moskva’s guns, in fact, that fired on Ukraine’s Snake Island in the first days of the war.","washington united provided intelligence helped ukrainian forces locate strike flagship russia

"U.S. Intelligence Is Helping Ukraine Kill Russian Generals, Officials Say","WASHINGTON — The United States has provided intelligence about Russian units that has allowed Ukrainians to target and kill many of the Russian generals who have died in action in the Ukraine war, according to senior American officials. Ukrainian officials said they have killed approximately 12 generals on the front lines, a number that has astonished military analysts. The targeting help is part of a classified effort by the Biden administration to provide real-time battlefield intelligence to Ukraine. That intelligence also includes anticipated Russian troop movements gleaned from recent American assessments of Moscow’s secret battle plan for the fighting in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, the officials said. Officials declined to specify how many generals had been killed as a result of U.S. assistance. The United States has focused on providing the location and other details about the Russian military’s mobile headquarters, which relocate frequently. Ukrainian officials have combined that geographic information with their own intelligence — including intercepted communications that alert the Ukrainian military to the presence of senior Russian officers — to conduct artillery strikes and other attacks that have killed Russian officers. The intelligence sharing is part of a stepped-up flow in U.S. assistance that includes heavier weapons and tens of billions in aid, demonstrating how quickly the early American restraints on support for Ukraine have shifted as the war enters a new stage that could play out over months. U.S. intelligence support to the Ukrainians has had a decisive effect on the battlefield, confirming targets identified by the Ukrainian military and pointing it to new targets. The flow of actionable intelligence on the movement of Russian troops that America has given Ukraine has few precedents. Since failing to advance on Kyiv, the capital, in the early part of the war, Russia has tried to regroup, with a more concentrated push in eastern Ukraine that so far has moved slowly and unevenly. Officials interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the classified intelligence being shared with Ukraine. The administration has sought to keep much of the battlefield intelligence secret, out of fear it will be seen as an escalation and provoke President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia into a wider war. American officials would not describe how they have acquired information on Russian troop headquarters, for fear of endangering their methods of collection. But throughout the war, the U.S. intelligence agencies have used a variety of sources, including classified and commercial satellites, to trace Russian troop movements. Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III went so far as to say last month that “we want to see Russia weakened to the degree it cannot do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine.” Asked about the intelligence being provided to the Ukrainians, John F. Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, said that “we will not speak to the details of that information.” But he acknowledged that the United States provides “Ukraine with information and intelligence that they can use to defend themselves.” After this article published, Adrienne Watson, a National Security Council spokeswoman, said in a statement that the battlefield intelligence was not provided to the Ukrainians “with the intent to kill Russian generals.” Not all the strikes have been carried out with American intelligence. A strike over the weekend at a location in eastern Ukraine where Gen. Valery Gerasimov, Russia’s highest-ranking uniformed officer, had visited was not aided by American intelligence, according to multiple U.S. officials. The United States prohibits itself from providing intelligence about the most senior Russian leaders, officials said. But American intelligence was critical in the deaths of other generals, officials acknowledged. The United States routinely provides information about the movement of Russian troops and equipment, and helps Ukraine confirm the location of critical targets. Other NATO allies also give real-time intelligence to the Ukrainian military. The Biden administration is also supplying new weaponry that should improve Ukraine’s ability to target senior Russian officers. The smaller version of the Switchblade drone, which is now arriving on the battlefield, can be used to identify and kill individual soldiers, and could take out a general sitting in a vehicle or giving orders on a front line. American officials have acknowledged publicly that the United States began giving Ukraine actionable intelligence in the run-up to Russia’s invasion on Feb. 24. Ahead of the invasion, for example, U.S. intelligence agencies warned of an impending attack on the Hostomel airport north of Kyiv. That allowed Ukraine to strengthen its defenses. Russian airborne forces were ultimately unable to hold the airfield. While the information the United States has provided Ukraine has proved valuable, Russian generals have often left themselves exposed to electronic eavesdropping by speaking over unsecure phones and radios, current and former American military officials said. Victory Day concerns. Officials across Ukraine issued urgent warnings about the threat of stepped-up Russian missile strikes over the weekend, amid fears that President Vladimir V. Putin might use Russia’s Victory Day holiday on May 9 to intensify attacks and turn what he calls a “special military operation” in Ukraine into explicit, all-out war. In Mariupol. In the ruined city, where fighting continued to rage, an evacuation convoy was dispatched again to the Azovstal steel plant, where about 200 civilians are believed to be trapped underground, along with the last Ukrainian soldiers defending the city. The Russian bombardment of the factory continued overnight. On the ground. Ukrainian soldiers are trying to drive Russian forces back from outside the two strategically important cities of Kharkiv and Izium. Russia appears to have escalated its attempts to trap and destroy Ukrainian units farther south. Russian oil embargo. The European Union unveiled a plan to halt imports of Russian crude oil in the next six months and refined oil products by the end of the year. If approved as expected, it would be the bloc’s biggest and costliest step yet toward ending its own dependence on Russian fossil fuels. “It shows poor discipline, lack of experience, arrogance and failure to appreciate Ukrainian capabilities,” said Frederick B. Hodges, the former top U.S. Army commander in Europe who is now with the Center for European Policy Analysis. “It is not hard to geo-locate someone on a phone talking in the clear.” Russian military tactics have also left senior generals vulnerable. A centralized, top-down command hierarchy gives decision-making authority only to the highest levels — compared to the more decentralized American structure that pushes many battlefield decisions to senior enlisted personnel and junior officers — forcing Russian generals to make risky trips to the front lines to resolve logistical and operational issues. “When there are problems, the general officers have to go sort it out,” said General Hodges. Although the administration remains wary of inflaming Mr. Putin to the point that he further escalates his attacks — President Biden has said he will not send American troops to Ukraine or establish a “no-fly zone” there — current and former officials said the White House finds some value in warning Russia that Ukraine has the weight of the United States and NATO behind it. Some European officials believe, despite Mr. Putin’s rhetoric that Russia is battling NATO and the West, he has so far been deterred from starting a wider war. American officials are less certain, and have been debating for weeks why Mr. Putin has not done more to escalate the conflict. Officials said Moscow has its own calculations to weigh, including whether it can handle a bigger war, particularly one that would allow NATO to invoke its mutual defense charter or enter the war more directly. “Clearly, we want the Russians to know on some level that we are helping the Ukrainians to this extent, and we will continue to do so,” said Evelyn Farkas, the former top Defense Department official for Russia and Ukraine in the Obama administration and currently the executive director of the McCain Institute. “We will give them everything they need to win, and we’re not afraid of Vladimir Putin’s reaction to that. We won’t be self-deterred.” But intelligence sharing is considered a safe form of help because it is invisible, or, at least, deniable. American intelligence has given secret information to Ukraine in a wide range of areas, from Russian troop movements to targeting data, officials said. Last month, the United States increased the flow of intelligence to Ukraine about Russian forces in the Donbas and Crimea, as Kyiv’s military forces prepared to defend against a renewed offensive by Moscow in eastern Ukraine, U.S. officials said. “There’s a significant amount of intelligence flowing to Ukraine from the United States,” Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a Senate panel on Tuesday. “We have opened up the pipes.” Michael Schwirtz contributed reporting from Ukraine.","washington united provided

"Virus Cases Grow After White House Correspondents Dinner","WASHINGTON — On Saturday, the comedian Trevor Noah stood before a ballroom of 2,600 journalists, celebrities and political figures at the White House Correspondents Dinner, and asked: What are we doing here? “Did none of you learn anything from the Gridiron Dinner? Nothing,” Mr. Noah said, referring to another elite Washington gathering in April, after which dozens of attendees tested positive for the coronavirus. “Do you read any of your own newspapers?” By Wednesday, Mr. Noah’s chiding remarks at what he called “the nation’s most distinguished superspreader event” were beginning to appear prophetic as a growing number of attendees, including a string of journalists and Antony J. Blinken, the secretary of state, said they had tested positive for the virus. Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said on Wednesday that President Biden had tested negative on Tuesday after attending the dinner unmasked. Ms. Psaki added that Mr. Blinken was not considered a close contact to Mr. Biden and “has not seen the president in several days.” The growing number of cases presented another sign of an official Washington that has largely returned to prepandemic routines, even as officials still urge Americans to take precautions, and has decided to live with the result. Journalists across several major news organizations reported testing positive. Among those were Jonathan Karl, ABC News’s chief Washington correspondent, who shook hands with Mr. Biden during the dinner, and Steve Herman, the chief national correspondent at Voice of America. CNN reported that those infected also included staff members from its network, as well as NBC News, CBS News and Politico. It was unclear exactly how many cases had been confirmed as of Wednesday evening. Steven Portnoy of CBS News, the president of the White House Correspondents’ Association, said late Wednesday that “the number of cases that have been brought to my attention now totals less than 1 percent of dinner attendees.” He added that “many” social gatherings in Washington over the weekend had more lenient Covid protocols than the association’s dinner. The dinner required proof of vaccination and a same-day negative test, and boosters were strongly encouraged. Some of the people reporting infections also said they had attended other gatherings over the weekend. Attendees at the dinner expressed resignation as the number of confirmed cases grew on Wednesday. “I’m yet another #WHCA weekend casualty,” Julia Ioffe, a founding partner and Washington correspondent at Puck News, announced on Twitter on Wednesday. “I knew I was taking a risk and, well, here we are!” Mark Leibovich, a reporter for The Atlantic who attended the dinner and who spoke briefly with Mr. Blinken at a gathering the day before, said there was an expectation that some guests would test positive. He noted that he had tested negative for the virus on Wednesday evening. “There was kind of a cruise ship vibe” to the dinner, said Mr. Leibovich, who was formerly a reporter at The New York Times. He added that once guests were inside the ballroom, “there was no escape” from the crowd. Jada Yuan, a reporter at The Washington Post who tested positive on Wednesday after attending the dinner, had said at the time that the ballroom was “like a horror film.” “No exits. Literally getting trapped between tables,” Ms. Yuan wrote on Twitter. “Fear of breathing near people but people are everywhere. Creeping sense that you’re the only one who know this is insane.” Many attendees of the event, known as the nerd prom, had gone through a good deal of risk-benefit calculation, considering whether the chance of contracting the coronavirus was worth attending the dinner and its ritzy before- and after-parties. The Post reported that some White House officials were worried that safety measures for the dinner were insufficient, and that the White House Correspondents’ Association had rebuffed an offer to have a company install — at no charge — devices that disinfect the air using ultraviolet light. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, Mr. Biden’s top medical adviser for the coronavirus, said he would not attend the dinner, citing his “individual assessment of my personal risk.” Dr. Fauci was later photographed attending a smaller outdoor pre-party before the dinner on Saturday.","washington saturday comedian trevor noah stood ballroom journalists celebrities political figures white house correspondents dinner learn gridiron dinner noah referring elite washington gathering april dozens attendees tested positive coronavirus read newspapers wednesday noah chiding remarks called nation distinguished superspreader event beginning prophetic growing attendees including string journalists antony blinken secretary tested positive virus jen psaki white house press secretary wednesday president biden tested negative tuesday attending dinner unmasked ms psaki added blinken considered close contact biden president days growing sign official washington returned prepandemic routines officials urge americans precautions decided live result journalists major news organizations reported testing positive jonathan karl abc news chief washington correspondent shook hands biden dinner steve herman chief national correspondent voice america cnn reported infected included staff network nbc news cbs news politico unclear confirmed wednesday evening steven portnoy cbs news president white house correspondents association late wednesday brought attention totals percent dinner attendees added social gatherings washington weekend lenient covid protocols association dinner dinner required proof vaccination day negative test boosters strongly encouraged people reporting infections attended gatherings weekend attendees dinner expressed resignation confirmed grew wednesday whca weekend casualty julia ioffe founding partner washington correspondent puck news announced twitter wednesday taking risk mark leibovich reporter atlantic attended dinner spoke briefly blinken gathering day expectation guests test positive noted tested negative virus wednesday evening cruise ship vibe dinner leibovich reporter york times added guests inside ballroom escape crowd jada yuan reporter washington post tested positive wednesday attending dinner time ballroom horror film exits literally trapped tables ms yuan wrote twitter fear breathing people people creeping sense insane attendees event nerd prom deal risk benefit calculation chance contracting coronavirus worth attending dinner ritzy parties post reported white house officials worried safety measures dinner insufficient white house correspondents association rebuffed offer company install charge devices disinfect air ultraviolet light dr anthony fauci biden top medical adviser coronavirus attend dinner citing individual assessment personal risk dr fauci photographed attending outdoor pre party dinner saturday"
