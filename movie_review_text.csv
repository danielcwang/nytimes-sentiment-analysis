"‘City of Lies’ Review: Dirty Cops and a Dangerous Conspiracy","Languishing since 2018, Brad Furman’s “City of Lies” is the latest attempt to monetize the unsolved 1990s murders of the rap artists Christopher Wallace (a.k.a. Notorious B.I.G.) and Tupac Shakur. The killings, previously wrestled with on film and in print, have spawned a morass of theories that would give even the most experienced filmmaker pause. Not Furman, though, who (with the screenwriter Christian Contreras) sets about dramatizing Randall Sullivan’s 2002 nonfiction book, the aptly named “LAbyrinth,” with rather more appetite than artistry. His focus is Russell Poole (Johnny Depp, confusing somnolent with serious), a former Los Angeles police detective still tormented by his investigation into Wallace’s death decades earlier. We know this because his depressing apartment is liberally plastered in details of the case. Into this psychological swamp comes Jack Jackson (Forest Whitaker), a journalist who’s working on a 20-year retrospective of the crimes. Jackson needs information, while Poole — who believes that the L.A.P.D. was actively involved in Wallace’s killing and the ensuing cover-up — needs a confessor. So we’re off down memory lane to watch Poole battle police corruption, hostile suspects and his antagonistic superiors. At heart a movie about one man’s self-destructive obsession (Poole was forced to resign two weeks shy of his pension), “City of Lies” has an underlying, unexpected poignancy. The look is grimy and the atmosphere is grim; but what could have been a moody character study or a taut conspiracy thriller is instead a dreary procedural, a misbegotten mush of flashbacks, voice-overs and dead ends.

"‘Crock of Gold’ Review: Shane MacGowan, Still Alive and Laughing","Around a third of the way into this lengthy, discursive, at times deliberately shambolic documentary about the Irish singer-songwriter Shane MacGowan, a few of the film’s participants address a question that people have been asking about the man since at least the early 1990s: “How is this guy still alive?” The answer seems to be that he just is. But a couple of interviewees insist that MacGowan’s prodigious drug and alcohol abuse (and general lack of self-care, long exemplified by MacGowan’s snaggletoothed maw of a mouth) is driven not by an appetite for self-destruction but a zest for life. This ostensible zest and an undeniable love of Irish culture is conveyed in a stew of movie clips, animation, onscreen chats and archival footage — much of it from when MacGowan, now 62, led the Pogues, a band that put a punk stamp on Irish music and hit big with “Fairytale of New York,” a hipster Christmas tune. The director Julien Temple — who has excellent documentaries on the Sex Pistols, Joe Strummer and other galvanic musicians under his belt — is very good at this sort of thing. As the movie’s subtitle, “A Few Rounds With Shane MacGowan,” implies, this is MacGowan’s show, not a conventional narrative on the music business. An inveterate “I did it my way” kind of guy, the singer, who now uses a wheelchair, declined to be interviewed formally. Instead he communes with famous friends, including the Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams and the actor Johnny Depp, who’s also a producer here. (“What makes you think I was able to stay awake through ‘Pirates’?” MacGowan asks Depp, who starred in the “Pirates of the Caribbean” film series. “What makes you think I did?” Depp answers.) MacGowan’s indescribable laugh, mixing the least aurally attractive aspects of hissing and gurgling, makes him disquieting company even when he’s waxing mildly eloquent.

"‘The Professor’ Review: The Lessons He Learns Along the Way","At the start of “The Professor,” a glib portrait about a dying academic, the title character, Richard (Johnny Depp), receives a diagnosis of stage-four lung cancer; without treatment, he has probably six months to live. His plan to tell his family is upstaged after, in a single evening at the dinner table, his daughter (Odessa Young) comes out and his wife (Rosemarie DeWitt) reveals that she’s having an affair with his university’s chancellor (Ron Livingston). So he keeps the news to himself. And the cancer, far from debilitating him (too much), transforms Richard into a free man. He drives around with shades on and his dog on his lap. He smokes a cigarette — he wasn’t a smoker before — and experiments sexually. To his students, he becomes a mad prophet, dismissing any members of the class who aren’t truly interested in literature and fashioning himself into an unhinged “Dead Poets Society” figure for the rest. (“Do not give into mediocrity like the other 98 percent of the world,” he advises his students, with whom he also smokes pot and drinks.) The writer-director Wayne Roberts complements this tired (at best) depiction of cancer as a liberating force with equally worn-out screenwriting devices, as when Richard lets loose in a mortifying toast at a formal dinner near the end. Depp’s turbocharged archness is basically the whole show. The actor appears as out of whits to give as the man he’s playing, with little interest in enunciating clearly or hiding his self-regard. His mugging can be fun to watch, but he is hardly convincing as a dying man.","start professor glib portrait dying academic title character richard johnny depp receives diagnosis stage lung cancer treatment months live plan family upstaged single evening dinner table daughter odessa wife rosemarie dewitt reveals affair university chancellor ron livingston news cancer debilitating transforms richard free drives shades dog lap smokes cigarette wasn smoker experiments sexually students mad prophet dismissing class aren literature fashioning unhinged dead poets society figure rest mediocrity percent world advises students smokes pot drinks writer director wayne roberts complements tired depiction cancer liberating force equally worn screenwriting devices richard loose mortifying toast formal dinner depp turbocharged archness basically actor appears whits playing enunciating hiding regard mugging fun watch convincing dying"
"‘Waiting for the Barbarians’ Review: An Aestheticized Fable of Colonialism","The stark sight of a western-style military outpost in the middle of a whole lot of desert nothingness, where “Waiting for the Barbarians” begins, may remind cinephiles of the 1976 Valerio Zurlini film “The Desert of the Tartars.” It’s unclear whether the director of this picture, Ciro Guerra, meant the scene as a homage to Zurlini’s film, but he didn’t even need to. As it happens, J.M. Coetzee, whose novel of the same name inspired this film, was likely influenced by Dino Buzzati’s book “The Tartar Steppe,” the source for “Tartars.” In an unnamed territory with Asian and Middle-Eastern characteristics (this is a fable, you see), the impeccable Mark Rylance as a western magistrate keeps benign watch on a local multiethnic population. From the magistrate’s European homeland comes Colonel Joll, a fussy authoritarian played by a quirky Johnny Depp, who makes a show out of pretending to be understated and seems under the impression that he’s still working with Tim Burton. Despite the magistrate’s protestations that no barbarian encroachment is in the offing, Joll is determined to crack down, which means the imprisonment and torture of innocents, just for starters. Later, Robert Pattinson, as a cruel Joll underling, joins the evil-doing, kicking in a few cartoon-imperialist sneers and sadistic laughs. The magistrate is not posited as a potential white savior. But he’s also not meaningfully aware of how, as a functionary of colonialism, he’s part of the problem. The movie’s disinclination to dig into this circumstance deprives it of potential dramatic depth. “Barbarians” instead aspires to hook an anti-colonialist mentality to an old-school Orientalist narrative style. Guerra aestheticizes everything to an extreme — for instance, showing one prisoner’s open torture wounds illuminated by old-masters firelight. Waiting for the Barbarians

"A Ferocious Satirist, With Ink as His Weapon","In 1969, Ralph Steadman, a British cartoonist and illustrator, was invited by the editors of Scanlan’s Monthly to attend the Kentucky Derby in the company of Hunter S. Thompson, who was writing an article about the race. This assignment marked the beginning of a long, fruitful and frequently volatile collaboration. Nine years after Thompson’s death, it is nearly impossible to think of his prose without conjuring visions of Mr. Steadman’s drawings — nightmarishly funny compositions in which spidery lines intersect with clouds of spilled and sprayed ink. Thompson casts a long shadow over “For No Good Reason,” Charlie Paul’s admiring documentary about Mr. Steadman. Thompson, the demigod of the New Journalism, appears in archival footage, some from older documentaries, cigarette holder clamped between his teeth, never far from a glass of whiskey or a dose of something crazier. The reminiscences of their adventures together are pretty crazy, too. A principle of Mr. Thompson’s style of journalism was to make himself part of the story, and whether they were covering the Honolulu marathon, the America’s Cup or the Ali-Foreman Rumble in the Jungle, he and Mr. Steadman became vivid characters in a pageant made surreal by their participation. It is tempting to regard Mr. Steadman, with his calm demeanor, mellow voice and lack of interest in drugs, as the sensible Sancho Panza to Thompson’s gonzo Quixote. But Jann S. Wenner, the publisher of Rolling Stone and as such their frequent underwriter, insists that the artist was the wilder of the two, and his work supports that thesis. Much of “For No Good Reason” consists of an extended visit to Mr. Steadman’s home in England, where he allows us a glimpse of his working methods, and explains himself, in a warm, tobacco-cured voice, to the audience. And to Johnny Depp, who in the film is both an audience surrogate and something of a distraction. Mr. Depp, who has played Thompson on screen twice (in Terry Gilliam’s “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas” and Bruce Robinson’s “The Rum Diary”), has become an unofficial custodian of the writer’s legacy. As such, his interest in Mr. Steadman is obviously sincere, but his presence exposes a serious weakness in Mr. Paul’s film, which does not seem to trust its subject or his work to be sufficiently interesting to hold the audience’s attention. This is evident not only in the repeated reaction shots that show Mr. Depp nodding sagely or gazing admiringly at Mr. Steadman’s drawings, but also, more egregiously, in the irrelevant pop songs plastered over images that would benefit from silent contemplation. And though it is padded to feature length with tangential interviews (for instance, with Mr. Gilliam and Richard E. Grant, star of “Withnail and I,” for which Mr. Steadman drew a poster), “For No Good Reason” is less revealing than a standard hourlong television tribute might have been. We learn almost nothing about Mr. Steadman’s life, and too little about the non-Thompson-related aspects of his oeuvre. But there is enough of the man and artist here to rekindle interest and appreciation in his often disturbing pictures and an understanding of what motivated them. He is a satirist of Swiftian ferocity, in a graphic tradition that includes the 20th-century German artists George Grosz and Otto Dix. He is intent above all at exposing the ugly face of authority and the harrowing facts of poverty and humiliation. His drawings of hungry children and homeless men mingle with caricatures of popes, plutocrats and presidents into an angry tableau of violence and injustice. Suspicion of power was something he and Thompson shared — their savage depictions of President Richard M. Nixon will live forever — but there is a formal discipline and thematic coherence to Mr. Steadman’s images that his friend’s writing sometimes lacked. Mr. Steadman has frequently aimed to shock, and almost always with good reason. “For No Good Reason” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Disturbing images and naughty tales.","ralph steadman british cartoonist illustrator invited editors scanlan monthly attend kentucky derby company hunter thompson writing article race assignment marked beginning fruitful frequently volatile collaboration thompson death impossible prose conjuring visions steadman drawings nightmarishly funny compositions spidery lines intersect clouds spilled sprayed ink thompson casts shadow reason charlie paul admiring documentary steadman thompson demigod journalism appears archival footage documentaries cigarette holder clamped teeth glass whiskey dose crazier reminiscences adventures pretty crazy principle thompson style journalism story covering honolulu marathon america cup ali foreman rumble jungle steadman vivid characters pageant surreal participation tempting regard steadman calm demeanor mellow voice lack drugs sancho panza thompson gonzo quixote jann wenner publisher rolling stone frequent underwriter insists artist wilder supports thesis reason consists extended visit steadman home england glimpse methods explains warm tobacco cured voice audience johnny depp film audience surrogate distraction depp played thompson screen terry gilliam fear loathing las vegas bruce robinson rum diary unofficial custodian writer legacy steadman sincere presence exposes weakness paul film trust subject sufficiently hold audience attention evident repeated reaction shots depp nodding sagely gazing admiringly steadman drawings egregiously irrelevant pop songs plastered images benefit silent contemplation padded feature length tangential interviews instance gilliam richard grant star withnail steadman drew poster reason revealing standard hourlong television tribute learn steadman life thompson related aspects oeuvre artist rekindle appreciation disturbing pictures understanding motivated satirist swiftian ferocity graphic tradition includes th century german artists george grosz otto dix intent exposing ugly authority harrowing poverty humiliation drawings hungry children homeless mingle caricatures popes plutocrats presidents angry tableau violence injustice suspicion power thompson shared savage depictions president richard nixon live forever formal discipline thematic coherence steadman images friend writing lacked steadman frequently aimed shock reason reason rated requires accompanying parent adult guardian disturbing images naughty tales"
"A Vampire Thirsty and Bewildered","Of all the morbid beauties in Tim Burton’s work, the spooky goth girls and deathly pale boys, none wear their ghoulishness as lightly or winningly as Johnny Depp. And what a bewitching corpse he makes in “Dark Shadows,” Mr. Burton’s most pleasurable film in years. As Barnabas Collins, the scion of a wealthy family turned unwilling vampire, Mr. Depp has a face as white as chalk and long-fingered hands that skim the air like skittering spiders. After 200 years of entombment, Barnabas awakes in 1972 and, like a latter-day Rip van Winkle, only thirstier, drinks in a world populated by monsters, living and dead, and lovingly adorned with Mr. Burton’s signature kinks. Mr. Burton’s exquisite detail work, his playfulness and macabre wit are justification enough for such an ephemeral enterprise, which fondly revisits the creaky, supernatural-themed American daytime soap that ran from 1966 to 1971. Created by Dan Curtis, whose other creep shows included “Kolchak: The Night Stalker,” “Dark Shadows” became a cult favorite when it introduced Barnabas (Jonathan Frid, who died last month), a vampire hero drawn along far more romantic lines than Bram Stoker’s Dracula. Mr. Burton’s movie, written by Seth Grahame-Smith (author of satirical novels like “Pride and Prejudice and Zombies”), riffs on the Barnabas origin story plucked from the soap and “House of Dark Shadows,” one of two films the show spawned.  8 Photos View Slide Show › In voice-over, Barnabas economically details the Collins family history in once-upon-a-time fashion, from its rise to its fall and including some disastrous lord-of-the-manor grappling with a maid, Angelique (the French actress Eva Green, frisky, funny and excellent), who paws at Barnabas’s body while Josette (Bella Heathcote, a typical Burton Kewpie doll and a recent Australian import) runs off with his heart. Three’s a crowd and Angelique is a witch, so after a little boil, toil and trouble, she casts a spell that leaves Josette dead and Barnabas bereft, fanged and weeping sanguineous tears. In typical horror fashion, a mob descends on him, leading to his timeout in a deep grave until he’s disinterred in the 1970s, whereupon Mr. Burton cues the Carpenters and happily cuts loose. Barnabas’s liberation does the same for Mr. Depp’s performance, and it’s delightful to watch how the actor handles the vampire’s readjustment to the world of the living, which, after he has thrown back some invigorating human Slurpees and faced down a “demon” (a car), he does with both lofty entitlement and abject bewilderment. Barnabas has the good looks of a vampire lover, but the character’s wide-eyed, somewhat baffled manner, in consort with his mysterious powers, means he mostly comes across like a visitor from another planet, more E. T. than Christopher Lee. Later, hiding from the sun under dark glasses, a fedora and an umbrella — Stoker’s creation moves around in daylight, too, so this isn’t as revisionist as it may seem — Barnabas also suggests the later-life Michael Jackson. Like Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood, the most memorable characters in Mr. Burton and Mr. Depp’s previous seven films together, Barnabas is at once recognizably human and inescapably different from the people around him. Alienation runs in his blood, literally. This sense of detachment remains even after he returns to the now-dilapidated Collins family manse, where, amid the picturesque decay and scattered children’s toys — a nice suburban touch — he meets his living descendants, including the matriarch, Elizabeth (a wonderful Michelle Pfeiffer, loopy and steely); her dissolute brother, Roger (Jonny Lee Miller); her teenage daughter, Carolyn (Chloë Grace Moretz); and Roger’s son, David (Gully McGrath), whose dark looks recall the evil tot in the 1976 horror flick “The Omen.” Barnabas, of course, fits right in with this freak show, even while remaining his own (dead) man. The movie is lightly ornamented with cinematic allusions. At one point David’s shrink, Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter), replicates the signature Shelley Winters image from “The Night of the Hunter,” while the caretaker, Loomis (Jackie Earle Haley), wields an ax that looks borrowed from Jack Nicholson in “The Shining.” Such sampling never becomes distracting and, with the terrific period songs (Curtis Mayfield, T. Rex, Iggy and the Stooges), gives “Dark Shadows” the feel of a pop-cultural archaeological dig. That makes sense given that Mr. Burton’s film resurrects an old television show that was partly inspired by the 1950s and ’60s vampire flicks produced by the British studio Hammer, which were in turn influenced by decades of fang-ster gore and glory. There is also something of a story, mostly involving Barnabas’s true love, if anyone’s interested, though traditional storytelling has never been Mr. Burton’s specialty or perhaps interest. What counts in his work is the telling, not the tale. He isn’t big on narrative logic, coherence and thrust — see “Mars Attacks!,” an exuberant free-for-all — focusing instead on his imagery, an emphasis that can either bore you to tears, as in his “Alice in Wonderland,” or, as in “Dark Shadows,” pleasantly slow everything down, allowing you to luxuriate in his embroidery and doodling, the paintings on the walls, the gloom in the halls. Although Mr. Burton’s talents can make him seem more like a production designer than a director, in his strongest films his visual style can be thrillingly expressive. “Dark Shadows” isn’t among Mr. Burton’s most richly realized works, but it’s very enjoyable, visually sumptuous and, despite its lugubrious source material and a sporadic tremor of violence, surprisingly effervescent. There has often been something moribund about Mr. Burton’s period efforts, and it may be that he tends to be more at ease, feels aesthetically freer, when he’s having fun with pop culture (his inert redo of “Planet of the Apes” excepted) than adapting high-culture classics. And while there may not be any deeper resonance lurking in his “Dark Shadows” — the show first surfaced in the middle of the Vietnam War, when real horror was playing out daily in the news — Mr. Burton’s gift for deviant beauty and laughter has its own liberating power. “Dark Shadows” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Some vampire violence and demonic sex.","morbid beauties tim burton spooky goth girls deathly pale boys wear ghoulishness lightly winningly johnny depp bewitching corpse makes dark shadows burton pleasurable film barnabas collins scion wealthy family unwilling vampire depp white chalk fingered hands skim air skittering spiders entombment barnabas awakes day rip van winkle thirstier drinks world populated monsters living dead lovingly adorned burton signature kinks burton exquisite detail playfulness macabre wit justification ephemeral enterprise fondly revisits creaky supernatural themed american daytime soap ran created dan curtis creep included kolchak night stalker dark shadows cult favorite introduced barnabas jonathan frid died month vampire hero drawn romantic lines bram stoker dracula burton movie written seth grahame smith author satirical novels pride prejudice zombies riffs barnabas origin story plucked soap house dark shadows films spawned photos view slide voice barnabas economically details collins family history time fashion rise fall including disastrous lord manor grappling maid angelique french actress eva green frisky funny excellent paws barnabas body josette bella heathcote typical burton kewpie doll recent australian import runs heart crowd angelique witch boil toil trouble casts spell leaves josette dead barnabas bereft fanged weeping sanguineous tears typical horror fashion mob descends leading timeout deep grave disinterred burton cues carpenters happily cuts loose barnabas liberation depp performance delightful watch actor handles vampire readjustment world living thrown invigorating human slurpees faced demon car lofty entitlement abject bewilderment barnabas vampire lover character wide eyed baffled manner consort mysterious powers means visitor planet christopher lee hiding sun dark glasses fedora umbrella stoker creation moves daylight isn revisionist barnabas suggests life michael jackson edward scissorhands ed wood memorable characters burton depp previous films barnabas recognizably human inescapably people alienation runs blood literally sense detachment remains returns dilapidated collins family manse amid picturesque decay scattered children toys nice suburban touch meets living descendants including matriarch elizabeth wonderful michelle pfeiffer loopy steely dissolute brother roger jonny lee miller teenage daughter carolyn chloë grace moretz roger son david gully mcgrath dark recall evil tot horror flick omen barnabas fits freak remaining dead movie lightly ornamented cinematic allusions david shrink dr julia hoffman helena bonham carter replicates signature shelley winters image night hunter caretaker loomis jackie earle haley wields ax borrowed jack nicholson shining sampling distracting terrific period songs curtis mayfield rex iggy stooges dark shadows feel pop cultural archaeological dig makes sense burton film resurrects television partly inspired s vampire flicks produced british studio hammer influenced decades fang ster gore glory story involving barnabas true love traditional storytelling burton specialty counts telling tale isn narrative logic coherence thrust mars attacks exuberant free focusing imagery emphasis bore tears alice wonderland dark shadows pleasantly slow allowing luxuriate embroidery doodling paintings walls gloom halls burton talents production designer director strongest films visual style thrillingly expressive dark shadows isn burton richly realized enjoyable visually sumptuous lugubrious source material sporadic tremor violence surprisingly effervescent moribund burton period efforts ease feels aesthetically freer fun pop culture inert redo planet apes excepted adapting culture classics deeper resonance lurking dark shadows surfaced middle vietnam war real horror playing daily news burton gift deviant beauty laughter liberating power dark shadows rated pg parents strongly cautioned vampire violence demonic sex"
"Beyond Fear and Loathing","Even if Alex Gibney’s new documentary, “Gonzo,” were not subtitled “The Life and Work of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson,” there would be little doubt about its subject. Thompson, who committed suicide in 2005, survives to some degree in the popular imagination because of his self-burnished reputation for wild excess. Embodied on the screen by Bill Murray (in Art Linson ‘s underrated “Where the Buffalo Roam” from 1980) and Johnny Depp (in Terry Gilliam’s overblown “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas” from 1998) and travestied as the conspiratorial Uncle Duke in Garry Trudeau’s “Doonesbury” comic strip, Thompson remains a durable icon of countercultural bad craziness. Gonzo, Thompson’s symbol for which was a two-thumbed fist clutching a peyote button, denotes a drug-fueled, madcap libertarianism, a pursuit of freedom to the very edge of good sense and beyond. But as Thompson first used the word, gonzo was an aurally suggestive, semantically vague adjective, and the noun it modified was, above all, journalist. And it is to Mr. Gibney’s great credit that while he pays due attention to the outsize, cartoonish celebrity persona Thompson fell back on when his literary powers began to wane, this film concentrates on the bold, innovative journalism that secured Thompson’s reputation and assures his immortality. A gangly, diffident Kentuckian with good manners and a mail-order divinity degree (hence the mock-honorific “Doctor”), Thompson had the good fortune to be around during a heroic and lawless age of American magazine writing, when visionary editors were willing to publish (and cover expenses for) all kinds of adventures and experiments. It was Carey McWilliams of The Nation who first printed Thompson’s chronicle of riding with the Hells Angels motorcycle gang, an article <U+0097> and, in 1966, a book <U+0097> that sketched out part of the emerging mythology of the ’60s, and also foreshadowed some of the era’s dissonances and contradictions. “Hell’s Angels” made Thompson something of a media star <U+0097> Mr. Gibney includes clips from one of the first of what would be many appearances as a television talk-show guest <U+0097> and introduced readers to the basic elements of his style and method. Those found fertile soil in the pages of Rolling Stone, whose founder and publisher, Jann Wenner, is among the witnesses gathered by Mr. Gibney to dish, critique and pay tribute. Others include Thompson’s two wives, Sandy and Anita; his son, Juan; and Ralph Steadman, the British artist whose drawings are nearly as integral to the Thompson oeuvre as the author’s own jazzy, swaybacked prose. The peanut gallery is filled out by some surprisingly establishmentarian figures, including Patrick J. Buchanan and George McGovern, who served the master of gonzo as sources and subjects when he turned his attention to politics. As it was for many others, the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago was a watershed for Thompson, who was appalled by the ferocity of Mayor Richard J. Daley’s police force. Thompson’s temperamental suspicion of authority took on a political dimension, which expressed itself through a characteristic mixture of earnestness and clowning. As a candidate for sheriff of Pitkin County, Colo., in 1970, he raised the banner of “freak power” and also raised serious issues about land use and law enforcement. And his reporting on the 1972 presidential election <U+0097> published in “Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail,” his masterpiece <U+0097> was a brazen mixture of passionate partisanship, scabrous insight and pure invention. It was “the least factual, most accurate account” of the election, according to Frank Mankiewicz, Mr. McGovern’s campaign manager. Making no pretense of neutrality, Thompson broadcast his admiration for Mr. McGovern and his contempt for Mr. McGovern’s Democratic rivals. He also expressed one of the great, sustaining passions of his writing life, namely his unquenchable hatred for Richard M. Nixon. Mr. Gibney, whose other films include “Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room” and the Oscar-winning “Taxi to the Dark Side,” assembles a lively collage of interviews and found materials. Mr. Depp reads choice excerpts from Thompson’s work, and the writer in his prime is glimpsed in scenes from earlier documentaries. “Gonzo” is a fascinating history lesson and a bit of a cautionary tale <U+0097> about the corrosive effects of rampant drug use, yes, but more about how fame can turn into the scourge of talent. Thompson’s creatively fallow years outnumbered his fertile ones, which can leave you feeling a bit deflated after two hours. But at his best he was braver, funnier and more ruthlessly honest than just about any other magazine writer, and “Gonzo” confirms his place in the great American parade of cranks, renegades and sages <U+0097> that is, in the best, most disreputable corner of our literary pantheon. “Gonzo” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for drug and sexual content, language and some nudity. .

"Comes an Aristocrat, Mustache Flaring","“Mortdecai” might as well be called “The Johnny Depp Movie,” because its preening star, wearing an ascot and a walrus mustache that becomes a tiresome running joke, is the whole show. And what a frantically dull spectacle this vanity project is. “Mortdecai,” directed by David Koepp from a screenplay by Eric Aronson, would never have been made without Mr. Depp’s enthusiasm for the source material, the first of the 1970s trilogy of farcical novels by the British author Kyril Bonfiglioli, in the P. G. Wodehouse tradition of sophisticated silliness. Mr. Depp’s wizardly expertise at disappearing into a character is intact. But what if that character isn’t funny and hasn’t an ounce of charm? Charlie Mortdecai, a bumbling aristocratic bon vivant and sociopath who lives beyond his means and deals in stolen art, is a vehicle for Mr. Depp to turn into a kind of Austin Powers manqué. There is no wink behind the wink because Mr. Depp is so busy showing off. The star has cited Peter Sellers and Terry-Thomas as inspirations for his creation, but as I watched the movie, the hybrid coming to mind was Charlie Chaplin and David Niven. Charlie Mortdecai lives in a mansion with his wife, Johanna (Gwyneth Paltrow affecting a barely passable British accent), and his loyal, studly manservant, Jock Strapp (Paul Bettany), whom he keeps shooting by accident and is the butt of many stale, smutty double entendres. Because Charlie owes 8 million pounds in unpaid taxes to the British government, his solution is to find and sell a missing Goya painting, “The Duchess of Wellington”; it’s rumored that the code to a Swiss bank account containing Nazi loot is scrawled on its back. He is joined on his adventures by a British security agent (Ewan McGregor). You have to admire Mr. Depp’s repertory of tics, which include eyebrows that jump up and down and a comic gait in which his stubby arms swing out from the sides as he lumbers along. Charlie’s adventures take him from London to Hong Kong, Moscow and Los Angeles and back. The momentum is so frenzied that you long for “Mortdecai” to ease up just long enough to allow its stars time for some witty banter. But the handful of moments that show Charlie’s fondness for pretentious upper-class verbiage are too few and far between and pass too quickly. About that mustache: Johanna is so revolted by it that a kiss activates her gag reflex. And there you have the movie’s only amusing gag (pardon the pun). It’s funny the first time, deadly when repeated. “Mortdecai” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

"Gallivanting Across Europe in High Heels and High Dudgeon","It takes a big man to hold the screen level when Angelina Jolie is around — usually the whole thing just tilts in her direction as soon as she struts into the frame. Her partner in crazy-time fame, Brad Pitt, helped keep the balance in “Mr. and Mrs. Smith,” their only film together. And now Johnny Depp tries to do much the same in “The Tourist.” Going for muted, eyeliner- and nearly irony-free, he plays an ordinary American who bumbles into a Continental intrigue, which looks like a film you’ve seen before, because you have. You know that movie. It’s the one in which Cary Grant and Grace Kelly don’t just travel by train, they also trade knowing looks in the first-class dining car as the waiter fills their glasses, and a shady type secretly takes their photo. The people behind “The Tourist” would like you to flash back to 1955 — as Ms. Jolie’s wardrobe of long gloves suggests — a risky strategy, given that you actually might. The truth is that it takes an exceptional director to prevent an entertainment as flimsy as this from collapsing under its own weightlessness. Alfred Hitchcock pulled it off with Grant and Kelly in “To Catch a Thief,” a bauble that sparkles like a jewel because of the world-class scenery, its stars included, and because of, well, the directing. Stargazing is the only reason bonbons like “The Tourist” are made, dreams of box office bonanzas aside. But stars need just the right setting and a director who knows how to make them shine, as Steven Soderbergh does with Mr. Pitt and George Clooney in the “Ocean’s” franchise. The director also needs to hold his own, which, from the generic look and feel of “The Tourist,” clearly wasn’t the case with Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. He does put personality into the occasional scene, including a mysterious, hushed interlude in which Ms. Jolie stands with her back to the camera as Mr. Depp creeps up from behind — lover or stalker, you’re not initially sure which — before pulling her close for a hungry kiss. It’s a nice idyll among a wash of clichés that include Russian muscle in service to a big meanie, Shaw (Steven Berkoff), whose quest for stolen loot leads him to Elise Ward (Ms. Jolie). A mystery woman of rare ability (she can pick a lock and wear off-the-shoulder gowns), she eludes Shaw while dodging assorted law enforcement agencies, including Scotland Yard, where Paul Bettany and Timothy Dalton curl stiff upper lips. Elise pauses long enough to slide into a train seat opposite Frank Tupelo (Mr. Depp), who, after gulping at his good fortune, explains that he’s a vacationing Wisconsin math teacher (as if!). Dinner leads to drinks leads to complications, including hailstorming bullets and a few sluggish boat chases in the Venice canals.  6 Photos View Slide Show › Hollywood has a long history of collecting (and devouring) European directors, but Mr. von Donnersmarck was an odd choice for froth like this. A few years ago he attracted some attention for “The Lives of Others,” a 2006 drama about an East German couple being spied on by a Stasi officer. Here, his main job seems to have been to find new and flattering ways to shoot Ms. Jolie as she catwalks from Paris to Venice in soaring heels. He tries to invest this adoration with some self-conscious wit, mostly by having all the men in the movie gawp at Elise as if she were as much a supernova as the one playing her. But all this genuflection — she parts one crowd as Moses does the Red Sea — feels forced rather than mischievous. It must be tough for Ms. Jolie to find roles that fit. Off screen she remains a fascinating presence, but on screen she now tends to overwhelm her roles and even her movies. Like every memorable screen star, she still has a face you can get lost in, with its push-pull of hard, jutting angles and well-endowed lips. It’s a face built for extremes, though early on she could also make it work for somewhat smaller, human-scaled roles that were nonetheless tricky for her. Superheroes and superfreaks have long been her truer calling, one reason that “The Tourist” seemed vaguely promising. When she first appears in a come-hither outfit and a small private smile, she looks ready for liftoff. She never ignites, and neither does the movie. Mr. Depp doesn’t fare better with a role that forces him to play meek and disappointingly mild, despite a few screenwriter-supplied tics. (Mr. von Donnersmarck shares writing credit with Christopher McQuarrie and Julian Fellowes.) A brilliant character actor and accidental movie star, Mr. Depp has rarely been persuasive playing average. He likes tunneling into his characters, preferably under a thick smear of makeup and flamboyant threads, which is why he’s never made sense in mainstream romance. There’s no place for him to hide with Frank, so he stands around trying to look hapless as Ms. Jolie grabs the lead. There’s definitely some amusement in watching her come to his rescue, a role reversal the movie only flirts with. But oh how much more fun it would have been if Mr. Depp had really played the girl, eyeliner and all. “The Tourist” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Bloodless violence.

"Hero Rides Again, With Big Boots to Fill","“Who was that masked man?” That is not a question likely to resonate much with young people today, unless they are asking it in earnest puzzlement. By young, I mean under 70. The Lone Ranger belongs to the ancient pop culture of the Great Depression and the early baby boom. His adventures were heard on radio, starting in the 1930s, and seen on television from 1949 to 1957, but unlike some of his cape-wearing peers, he has mostly stayed in the past, an object of fuzzy nostalgia and mocking incredulity, a symbol of simple pleasures and retrograde attitudes. Until now. Someone in the Disney-Jerry Bruckheimer corporate suites has decided that today’s kids need their own version of the white-hat western hero with his laconic Indian sidekick, and so now we have “The Lone Ranger,” a very long, very busy movie that will unite the generations in bafflement, stupefaction and occasional delight. Directed by Gore Verbinski from a script credited to Justin Haythe, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, the movie tries to do for the post-Civil-War frontier what the “Pirates of the Caribbean” franchise did for the high seas in the Age of Sail, turning history (including the history of movies) into a hyperactive, multipurpose amusement machine. There are moments when this approach — which combines fussy, facetious knowingness with naïve, omnivorous enthusiasm — pays off nicely. The main action of “The Lone Ranger” takes place in a fantastical 1869 Texas, but it’s framed by scenes set in San Francisco in 1933, the year the Lone Ranger made his radio debut. As the half-built Golden Gate Bridge looms in the background, a young boy in cowboy duds and a black mask wanders into a Wild West fairground attraction, where he gazes on a taxidermied buffalo and grizzly bear, and also on an elderly American Indian with a dead crow on his head. A brass plate identifies him as “The Noble Savage in his Native Habitat.” The boy comes to know him as Tonto, and the rest of us recognize him, even under heavy prosthetic wrinkles, as Johnny Depp. Turning an aging, weary Tonto into a somewhat unreliable narrator signals that we are in a world of tall tales and strange myths, a universe of stories that fed the imaginations of many American children in the early and middle decades of the last century and that may strike their descendants as archaic and a little embarrassing. Sturdy western archetypes sit uncomfortably close to ugly ethnic stereotypes, and “The Lone Ranger” tries to imagine a wholesome, inclusive version of the western while reviving the time-tested touchstones of the genre. The result is a frantic grab bag of plots and themes, a semester-long Westerns 101 college course crammed into two and a half hours and taught by a professor whose lecture notes were rearranged by a gust of wind on his way to class. The wide-open spaces of Monument Valley (which is not really in Texas, but never mind) are heavily populated with familiar characters: vengeful Comanches (their ancient chief is played by Saginaw Grant); an unscrupulous railroad tycoon (Tom Wilkinson); a blond-maned cavalry officer (Barry Pepper); a varminty, snaggletoothed outlaw (William Fichtner); a sharp-tongued madam (Helena Bonham Carter); and a stoical pioneer mom (Ruth Wilson), whose husband (James Badge Dale) is a Texas Ranger named Dan Reid. The Lone Ranger is Dan’s brother, John (Armie Hammer), an idealistic government lawyer who arrives in town armed with a copy of John Locke’s “Two Treatises of Government” and whose belief in the rule of law will be sorely tested. John, who does not carry a gun, carries a torch for his brother’s wife and eventually acquires a mysterious white horse, the “William Tell Overture” and the moniker kemo sabe, bestowed by his newfound sidekick, Tonto. Tonto also persuades him to cover his eyes, which generates a new spin on the old catchphrase: “What’s with the mask?” There is no doubting Mr. Verbinski’s appreciation of film history. He has seen and studied, at a minimum, “The Searchers,” “Once Upon a Time in the West,” “The General” and the Road Runner cartoons of Chuck Jones. (As well as his own “Rango,” a much better western than this one.) All of these influences and more are put to hectic, intermittently inspired use. Some of the action sequences combine the kinetic wit of classic cartoons with the inventive rigor of Buster Keaton movies, and Mr. Depp’s blend of gravity and goofiness saves the day, or at least alleviates the tedium, on several occasions. In the end, though, “The Lone Ranger” can’t quite pull off the daredevil feats it has assigned itself. This is an ambitious movie disguised as a popcorn throwaway, nothing less than an attempt to revise, reinvigorate and make fun of not just its source but also nearly every other western ever made. In trying to balance grandiosity with playfulness, to lampoon cowboy-and-Indian clichés while taking somber account of a history of violence, greed and exploitation, it descends into nerve-racking incoherence. Atrocities are followed by jokey riffs and sight gags, and what links them is not a creative sensibility (as would be the case in a Quentin Tarantino movie) but a carnival barker’s desperate need to hold on to a distracted audience’s attention. Look, kids, a man eating another man’s heart! A horse in a tree! A genocidal massacre! Bunny rabbits with sharp teeth! “Who was that masked man?” is a less relevant question than “What on earth were you thinking?” “The Lone Ranger” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). The violence, while frequently stylized and carefully edited, is actually more intense and nasty than the rating would suggest.","masked question resonate people earnest puzzlement lone ranger belongs ancient pop culture depression baby boom adventures heard radio starting television unlike cape wearing peers stayed past object fuzzy nostalgia mocking incredulity symbol simple pleasures retrograde attitudes disney jerry bruckheimer corporate suites decided kids version white hat western hero laconic indian sidekick lone ranger busy movie unite generations bafflement stupefaction occasional delight directed gore verbinski script credited justin haythe ted elliott terry rossio movie post civil war frontier pirates caribbean franchise seas age sail history including history movies hyperactive multipurpose amusement machine moments approach combines fussy facetious knowingness naïve omnivorous enthusiasm pays nicely main action lone ranger takes fantastical texas framed scenes set san francisco lone ranger radio debut half built golden gate bridge looms background boy cowboy duds black mask wanders wild west fairground attraction gazes taxidermied buffalo grizzly bear elderly american indian dead crow head brass plate identifies noble savage native habitat boy tonto rest recognize heavy prosthetic wrinkles johnny depp aging weary tonto unreliable narrator signals world tall tales strange myths universe stories fed imaginations american children middle decades century strike descendants archaic embarrassing sturdy western archetypes sit uncomfortably close ugly ethnic stereotypes lone ranger imagine wholesome inclusive version western reviving time tested touchstones genre result frantic grab bag plots themes semester westerns college crammed half hours taught professor lecture notes rearranged gust wind class wide spaces monument valley texas mind heavily populated familiar characters vengeful comanches ancient chief played saginaw grant unscrupulous railroad tycoon tom wilkinson blond maned cavalry officer barry pepper varminty snaggletoothed outlaw william fichtner sharp tongued madam helena bonham carter stoical pioneer mom ruth wilson husband james badge dale texas ranger named dan reid lone ranger dan brother john armie hammer idealistic government lawyer arrives town armed copy john locke treatises government belief rule law sorely tested john carry gun carries torch brother wife eventually acquires mysterious white horse william overture moniker kemo sabe bestowed newfound sidekick tonto tonto persuades cover eyes generates spin catchphrase mask doubting verbinski appreciation film history studied minimum searchers time west road runner cartoons chuck jones rango western influences hectic intermittently inspired action sequences combine kinetic wit classic cartoons inventive rigor buster keaton movies depp blend gravity goofiness saves day alleviates tedium occasions lone ranger pull daredevil feats assigned ambitious movie disguised popcorn throwaway attempt revise reinvigorate fun source western balance grandiosity playfulness lampoon cowboy indian clichés taking somber account history violence greed exploitation descends nerve racking incoherence atrocities jokey riffs sight gags links creative sensibility quentin tarantino movie carnival barker desperate hold distracted audience attention kids eating heart horse tree genocidal massacre bunny rabbits sharp teeth masked relevant question earth thinking lone ranger rated pg parents strongly cautioned violence frequently stylized carefully edited intense nasty rating suggest"
"I Am My Own Monster (Technology Rules!)","Johnny Depp, who’s built a brilliant career despite many of his lamentable film choices, may not be the first actor you think of to play a genius — much less humanity’s destroyer or savior. But he’s weirdly perfect in “Transcendence,” an inelegant, no doubt implausible (maybe not) science-fiction film about a futurist whose consciousness is uploaded onto the Internet. There, he (or a mysterious vestige of his being) expands like the universe, growing larger and mutating into a being who is godlike and yet far from divine, sort of like a star at the apex of his popularity. Directed by Wally Pfister, a cinematographer making his feature directing debut, “Transcendence” is a dark, lurchingly entertaining pastiche of age-old worries, future-shock jolts, hot-button topics and old-fashioned genre thrills. It was written by Jack Paglen, who, while researching, probably thumbed through Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus,” along with some Isaac Asimov and William Gibson. The scientist here is Will Caster (Mr. Depp), whose work in artificial intelligence has landed him on the cover of Wired magazine. (Even in a brave new world, old media remains useful shorthand.) With his wife, Evelyn (Rebecca Hall), a computer scientist, Will has created PINN, one of those supermachines with sleek surfaces, blinking lights and pulsating menace. The twist in “Transcendence” is that the scientist becomes the monster of his own creation or so it seems. Shortly after the film opens, Will is shot by an extremist during a series of coordinated attacks on high-tech targets. He survives the initial assault only to succumb to the radiation that laced the bullet. As he lies dying, Evelyn, in one of those eureka moments that implies her brain is as infinite as her husband’s, initially uploads Will’s consciousness into PINN, a clever bit of business she manages with their friend Max Waters (a solid Paul Bettany), a neurobiologist. One minute Will looks like a tortured lab monkey; the next, he’s the ghost in everybody’s machine. Well, it sounds plausible or at least Mr. Pfister moves fast enough that you don’t have time to puzzle over niceties like logic. Like some other notable machine-based intelligences — including the ship’s computer in the original “Star Trek,” CORA in the television series “Battlestar Galactica” and Samantha in Spike Jonze’s recent film “Her” — PINN has a female voice. It may be that the enduringly creepy legacy of HAL 9000, the mutinous computer from “2001: A Space Odyssey,” has made it tougher for male voices to fill in these disembodied characters. Whatever the case, while artificial intelligences with any kind of human voice seem at once familiar and uncanny, further blurring the line between makers and their machines, those with female voices also suggest another creation story, that of Adam (the origin) and Eve (the product). “Transcendence” plays with this idea, and it’s not for nothing that its heroine is named Evelyn. Once Will’s consciousness is uploaded, his voice supplants PINN’s. In its initial poetic fragmentation, the voice emanating from Evelyn’s reconfigured supercomputer sounds amusingly like Marlon Brando’s tape-recorded ramblings as Colonel Kurtz in “Apocalypse Now.” (Mr. Depp and Brando were friends.) After some throat clearing, though, Will starts to sound like himself and the movie gets its crazy on. His image pops up on screen, like some holographic specter, a kind of rebirth that thrills Evelyn and freaks out most everyone else, including, naturally enough, the extremists. Implausibly led by a scowling half-pint, Bree (Kate Mara), they try to stop Will and Evelyn, in a chase that also pulls in other scientists and government agents played by the likes of Morgan Freeman and Cillian Murphy. Mr. Pfister, shooting on film and working with the cinematographer Jess Hall, gives “Transcendence” the dark, gleaming surfaces that gloss up a lot of contemporary thrillers and which can’t help evoking Christopher Nolan’s work. Mr. Pfister has been the director of photography on most of Mr. Nolan’s films, including the “Dark Knight” trilogy, and Mr. Nolan has given “Transcendence” his blessing by signing on as an executive producer. So it’s no surprise that the depthless blacks and glowing whites in “Transcendence” and Mr. Pfister’s use of negative space suggest Mr. Nolan’s influence, notably in the high-tech complex where Evelyn and Will set up a compound. When Evelyn walks down one of its luminous white halls, she looks as if she’s headed right for one of Bruce Wayne’s lairs. These visual echoes don’t hurt “Transcendence,” and they soon recede amid the escalating narrative noise. Mr. Pfister handles the predictable third-act action booms adequately — it must be contractual that every director who makes a thriller these days must blow his sets to smithereens — but he’s better when the story scales down. When Evelyn appears in that white hallway, Mr. Pfister is showing off the production design, but he’s also bringing you close to a woman who, as Will’s power expands, is becoming progressively more isolated. One of those actresses who always seem smart even in dumb roles, Ms. Hall is very sympathetic as a woman in love and then in fear who, scene by scene and with palpable tenderness, takes over the film as Will gobbles up the world. To an extent, “Transcendence” can be filed alongside other movies about fanaticism that have emerged since Sept. 11. Yet, for all its topical gloss and technobabble, it also draws from older, familiar preoccupations about the nature of being, which, along with Mr. Pfister’s eye and largely smooth handling of his actors, accounts for its modest pleasures. However predictable and ridiculous, the film raises the question of what — as the machines rise — makes us human and why, which certainly gives you more to chew on at the multiplex than is customary these days. In “Frankenstein,” the monster tells his creator, “I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel.” This is the warning that pulses through many dystopian fictions and which here finds another beat. “Transcendence” is rated PG-13. (Parents strongly cautioned.)

"In San Juan, on the Road to Gonzo","“The Rum Diary,” directed by Bruce Robinson (“Withnail and I”) and based on an early novel of the same title by Hunter S. Thompson, will appeal to anyone who harbors romantic ideas about liquor, newspaper journalism or that mythical late-Eisenhower, early-Kennedy “Mad Men” time when the ’60s were getting ready to happen. Connoisseurs of straw hats and cool sunglasses will find much to savor, as will aficionados of guilt-free cigarette smoking and midday boozing. A mild lark disguised as a wild bender, “The Rum Diary” is also a touching tribute to Thompson himself, who committed suicide in 2005. Thompson’s alter ego, a young writer named Paul Kemp, is played by Johnny Depp. This makes the new film a prequel of sorts to Terry Gilliam’s “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas” (1998), in which Mr. Depp impersonated Thompson in his full Gonzo glory, with Hawaiian-print shirts draped over his torso and wild hallucinations sprouting from his balding pate. Kemp is, at least at first glance, a more conventional fellow, arriving at his new job at an English-language San Juan daily, in the grip of a serious hangover but otherwise more presentable than some of his colleagues. These include a burly, shaggy photographer named Bob Sala (Michael Rispoli) and a filthy, booze-addled wraith known as Moberg (Giovanni Ribisi). The two of them become Paul’s roommates and co-conspirators in a rambling adventure that pits them, somewhat woozily, against the editor of their newspaper (Richard Jenkins) and a cabal of neocolonialist real estate developers. This is not really “Fear and Loathing in Puerto Rico” but rather the literary equivalent of a superhero origin story, in that it supplies fans with the chronicle of how a more-or-less ordinary guy transformed himself into a beloved archetype. “I haven’t figured out how to write as myself,” Paul says at one point, and as he chafes against the requirements of his job and the foul corruption of his environment, he is also undergoing the testing ordeal that will ultimately give him a voice and a vocation. His nemesis — every superhero needs one — is Hal Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart), a great white sharpie who seems to possess everything Paul desires. Hal, a flack for the predatory, moneyed interests who want to despoil a pristine island, has a luxurious house on the beach, a sweet red sports car and a sexy fiancée named Chenault (Amber Heard) who seems to have eyes for Paul. Hal also sees Paul as a target for seduction, offering him a vaguely defined but apparently crucial role in his lucrative development scheme. Paul’s journalistic skills and connections (especially if he’s spuriously identified as a correspondent for an important mainland paper) will be an asset. And so Paul’s drunken meanderings lead him to a crossroad, with Hal and Moberg representing opposed, cautionary visions of a plausible future. With his talent and looks, his good breeding and passable manners, Paul could easily sell out and settle into a version of Hal’s cushy, corrupt existence. Or if his taste for alcohol overtakes him — he rates his drinking “at the higher end of social” — he could end up a wasted wreck like his colleague. Instead, of course, he turns into Hunter S. Thompson, an evolution foreshadowed throughout “The Rum Diary” in ways that will delight Thompson devotees. Sala, good-hearted and oddly practical in spite of himself, is a prototype of Dr. Gonzo, the bulky lawyer who would be Sancho to Thompson’s Quixote in “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.” Paul’s comments as he watches Richard M. Nixon and John F. Kennedy debate on television prefigure both the Nixon hatred that would be one of Thompson’s great passions and the mix of prophecy and paranoia that would characterize his political writing. “The Irishman will win,” he predicts. “But they won’t let him live.” In the course of a narrative that both steers toward and swerves away from a beat-the-bad-guys, get-the-girl ending, Kemp locates his ethical center of gravity, recovers his chivalrous instincts and reconciles his appetites with his awakening sense of mission. “What did we take?” he asks, after he and Sala have dosed themselves with a powerful and unnamed hallucinogen. “We’ll need to get some more!” Later he declares, “I put the bastards of the world on notice that I do not have their best interests at heart.” Together those statements might stand as a précis of the vivid and improbable real career that took shape after the fictional events depicted in this film. Which on balance is more a confirmation of existing legends than a revelation. Mr. Depp, drawing in his mouth and lowering the register of his voice, is reliably unpredictable and predictably cool, but as is so often the case lately, he seems to be acting from behind the mask of his own charisma. Ms. Heard does what she can to overcome the essentially decorative nature of her part, while most of the rest of the cast does whatever mugging or ranting seems appropriate. The exception is Mr. Rispoli, whose sweaty, anxious geniality is the most interesting and authentic thing in the movie. The rest is pleasant enough, which may sound more damning than I mean it to, given Thompson’s reputation. “The Rum Diary” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Sex, drugs, profanity, drinking — what part of “Hunter S. Thompson” did you not understand? THE RUM DIARY Opens on Friday nationwide.

"Review: ‘Alice Through the Looking Glass’ and a Trippy Time Machine","The best and maybe the only way to appreciate “Alice Through the Looking Glass” is to surrender to its mad digital excess and be whirled around through time and space in a world of grotesque overabundance. This sequel to Tim Burton’s “Alice in Wonderland,” directed by James Bobin (“The Muppets”), is so cluttered with an unwieldy mixture of Victoriana and special-effects gadgetry that every nook and cranny is crammed with stuff. There’s more to gape at than the eye can take in. A symbol of that excess is a table set for a two-person tea party whose piles of goodies contain enough sugary calories to fell an entire Navy battalion from diabetic shock. Were it not for sweets, there would hardly be a story. Like Mr. Burton, whose original film made over $1 billion at the global box office, Mr. Bobin believes in taking opulence and extravagance to extremes. One of the major plot threads concerns the conflict between the evil Red Queen, Iracebeth (a feisty, snapping Helena Bonham Carter), and her sister, the angelic White Queen, Mirana (a pallid Anne Hathaway). Iracebeth’s bitterness dates to a childhood incident involving cake crumbs, in which she is blamed for Mirana’s mess. The sibling feud escalates into a global conflict that at one point stops time itself. Credit the plot of that Broadway juggernaut “Wicked,” recycled for “Through the Looking Glass,” as the gift that keeps on giving. At least “Alice Through the Looking Glass” isn’t saddled with formulaic Disney songs, although as its perspective grows more cosmic, Danny Elfman’s score settles into a mood of overawed grandiosity. What does all this have to do with Lewis Carroll? Hardly anything. It’s just an excuse on which to hang two trite overbearing fables and one amusing one. One involves a mean girl, a nice girl and forgiveness; the second a father-son schism. The third is science-fiction tomfoolery Carroll might have appreciated. Alice has her own problems. After her seafaring adventures establishing trade routes to China on her ship, the Wonder, she returns to England to find that a rejected suitor, Hamish (Leo Bill), has maneuvered the sale of her precious ship by persuading Alice’s mother (Lindsay Duncan) to agree to a dubious deal. The liberated, adventurous Alice will from now on be trapped in stuffy Victorian England. The discontinuity between the movie and its source material means that classic Carroll inventions like Tweedledee and Tweedledum (Matt Lucas), the Cheshire Cat (Stephen Fry), the Dormouse (Barbara Windsor) and the White Rabbit (Michael Sheen) are trotted out as members of Alice’s posse, but except for some signature visual quirks and well-cast voices, they are less characters than decorative nostalgic touchstones. Carroll’s deeply subversive, nonsensical embrace of the absurd and truly strange has been mostly painted over. transcript NA Leading the list of stars returning from Mr. Burton’s 2010 film is Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter, an eccentric neurotic loner first seen dying of a broken heart, whom he imbues with pathos and wit. He has been chronically depressed since the day his strict, conservative father scoffed at his first attempt at hat making. His search for his parents, presumed dead at the end of the first film, ignites the third subplot in which his best friend, Alice, equipped with a whirly gyroscopic time machine called a Chronosphere, tries to alter the past to change the future. Alice’s temporal gyrations between present and past as she dives in and out of the liquid mirror give “Through the Looking Glass” a jarring whiz-bang momentum that intensifies and accelerates as the movie hurtles along. Mia Wasikowska’s Alice Kingsleigh is a thoroughly modern young superwoman outfitted in sumptuous Victorian costumes, and the latest Disney heroine viewed through a feminist lens. To procure the Chronosphere, Alice must steal the device from Time himself (Sacha Baron Cohen), a cranky half-human control freak with a ticking timepiece for a heart and an Austrian accent, living in a castle that suggests a giant clock. As uninspired and warmed over as you may find the narrative strands of the movie — with a screenplay by Linda Woolverton, who also wrote “Alice in Wonderland” — its unpredictable, rampaging sense of time lends it a manic energy in keeping with Carroll’s vision of nonsensical disorder. Whirring clocks accelerate and reverse time and sometimes become stuck, conveying a demented zaniness. These are the only scenes in which the adjective “wondrous” truly applies. Most of the other special effects belong to a chilly post-“Star Wars” aesthetic. Yes, they are spectacular enough to keep your eyes glued to the screen, even when attention wanders from the clichéd subplots. But the cumulative effect is a nonstop ride on a 21st-century roller coaster. In the end, to paraphrase the Beatles, everyone is desperate to get back to where they once belonged. And in the Disney tradition, needless to say, everyone arrives home safe and sound. “Alice Through the Looking Glass” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for perilous sequences. Running time: 1 hour 48 minutes.","alice glass surrender mad digital excess whirled time space world grotesque overabundance sequel tim burton alice wonderland directed james bobin muppets cluttered unwieldy mixture victoriana special effects gadgetry nook cranny crammed stuff gape eye symbol excess table set person tea party piles goodies sugary calories fell entire navy battalion diabetic shock sweets story burton original film billion global box office bobin believes taking opulence extravagance extremes major plot threads concerns conflict evil red queen iracebeth feisty snapping helena bonham carter sister angelic white queen mirana pallid anne hathaway iracebeth bitterness dates childhood incident involving cake crumbs blamed mirana mess sibling feud escalates global conflict stops time credit plot broadway juggernaut wicked recycled glass gift giving alice glass isn saddled formulaic disney songs perspective grows cosmic danny elfman score settles mood overawed grandiosity lewis carroll excuse hang trite overbearing fables amusing involves girl nice girl forgiveness father son schism science fiction tomfoolery carroll appreciated alice seafaring adventures establishing trade routes china ship returns england rejected suitor hamish leo bill maneuvered sale precious ship persuading alice mother lindsay duncan agree dubious deal liberated adventurous alice trapped stuffy victorian england discontinuity movie source material means classic carroll inventions tweedledee tweedledum matt lucas cheshire cat stephen fry dormouse barbara windsor white rabbit michael sheen trotted alice posse signature visual quirks cast voices characters decorative nostalgic touchstones carroll deeply subversive nonsensical embrace absurd strange painted transcript na leading list stars returning burton film johnny depp mad hatter eccentric neurotic loner dying broken heart imbues pathos wit chronically depressed day strict conservative father scoffed attempt hat search parents presumed dead film ignites subplot friend alice equipped whirly gyroscopic time machine called chronosphere alter past change future alice temporal gyrations past dives liquid mirror glass jarring whiz bang momentum intensifies accelerates movie hurtles mia wasikowska alice kingsleigh modern superwoman outfitted sumptuous victorian costumes disney heroine viewed feminist lens procure chronosphere alice steal device time sacha baron cohen cranky half human control freak ticking timepiece heart austrian accent living castle suggests giant clock uninspired warmed narrative strands movie screenplay linda woolverton wrote alice wonderland unpredictable rampaging sense time lends manic energy keeping carroll vision nonsensical disorder whirring clocks accelerate reverse time stuck conveying demented zaniness scenes adjective wondrous applies special effects belong chilly post star wars aesthetic spectacular eyes glued screen attention wanders clichéd subplots cumulative effect nonstop ride st century roller coaster paraphrase beatles desperate belonged disney tradition needless arrives home safe sound alice glass rated pg parental guidance suggested perilous sequences running time hour minutes"
"Review: ‘Dead Men Tell No Tales.’ Not Very Well, Anyway.","This review will be short and dismissive. The movie under consideration — “Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales” — is, by contrasts, long and punishing. Its pleasures are so meager, its delight in its own inventions so forced and false, that it becomes almost the perfect opposite of entertainment. To insist otherwise is a variation on the sunk cost fallacy. Since you exchanged money for fun, fun is surely what you must have purchased, and you may cling to that idea in the face of contrary evidence. But trust me on this: This movie would be a rip-off even if someone paid you to see it. Because, to be honest, it’s barely a movie at all. The first installments of the “Pirates” franchise conquered skepticism with exuberance and charm. Somehow, a theme-park ride combined with clever, madcap visuals and Johnny Depp’s scapegrace showboating added up to something fresh. But that spirit is long gone. Mr. Depp, as Capt. Jack Sparrow, goes through the motions like a washed-up rock star reprising his greatest hits in a half-empty auditorium. The images are so dark and muddy that you can’t see what’s going on well enough to know why you don’t care. The plot twists, Easter eggs and surprises are either obvious or labored. You can’t spoil something that’s already thoroughly rotten. Now and then you get a reminder of why you might have enjoyed the earlier movies. There are a couple of nifty Rube Goldbergian action sequences — one with a bank vault, the other with a guillotine — that recall the berserk inventiveness of Gore Verbinski, the original director. But otherwise, “Dead Men Tell No Tales,” directed by Joachim Ronning and Espen Sandberg from a script by Jeff Nathanson, is a tedious rehash. Two appealing young people (Kaya Scodelario and Brenton Thwaites) meet on a quest for a mysterious and powerful object. They are joined by Sparrow and pursued by old and new enemies: the British Navy; the greedy pirate Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush); and an army of ghouls led by the spectral Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem), known as the butcher of the sea. This goes on for more than two hours. You are invited to sit through every last name on the lengthy end credits for a teasing extra scene of a couple asleep on linen sheets, a reminder of how you might have better spent the time. It would be a spoiler to identify those bedfellows, but the bigger spoiler is that apparently another sequel is on the way.","review short dismissive movie consideration pirates caribbean dead tales contrasts punishing pleasures meager delight inventions forced false perfect opposite entertainment insist variation sunk cost fallacy exchanged money fun fun surely purchased cling idea contrary evidence trust movie rip paid honest barely movie installments pirates franchise conquered skepticism exuberance charm theme park ride combined clever madcap visuals johnny depp scapegrace showboating added fresh spirit depp capt jack sparrow motions washed rock star reprising hits half empty auditorium images dark muddy don care plot twists easter eggs surprises obvious labored spoil rotten reminder enjoyed earlier movies couple nifty rube goldbergian action sequences bank vault guillotine recall berserk inventiveness gore verbinski original director dead tales directed joachim ronning espen sandberg script jeff nathanson tedious rehash appealing people kaya scodelario brenton thwaites meet quest mysterious powerful object joined sparrow pursued enemies british navy greedy pirate hector barbossa geoffrey rush army ghouls led spectral captain salazar javier bardem butcher sea hours invited sit lengthy credits teasing extra scene couple asleep linen sheets reminder spent time spoiler identify bedfellows bigger spoiler apparently sequel"
"Review: In ‘Black Mass,’ Johnny Depp Is the Dead-Eyed Killer Whitey Bulger","Currently a permanent guest of the federal government after 16 years as a fugitive, James J. Bulger was, in the 1970s and ’80s, Boston’s most notorious criminal. While his younger brother William served as president of the Massachusetts State Senate, James (referred to as Whitey, though he disliked the nickname) ran the Winter Hill Gang, an especially vicious enterprise in a business not known for delicacy. He also enjoyed a cozy relationship with the local office of the F.B.I., which turned a blind eye to his crimes in exchange for information about the activities of his rivals. He was a government informer who meted out lethal punishment to suspected rats; a remorseless killer viewed as a folk hero by some of his fellow citizens; a sentimental son of South Boston who brought drugs into his own neighborhood, and his story all but begs for a movie. Some elements of it have already made it to the screen. “The Departed,” Martin Scorsese’s remake of a classic Hong Kong crime film, incorporates aspects of the Whitey Bulger legend. “Whitey,” Joe Berlinger’s solid documentary, looks squarely in the faces of his victims and their families, dispelling some of the aura of gangster romance that always seems to surround white ethnic practitioners of organized crime. transcript N/A “Black Mass,” Scott Cooper’s new film, puts some of that luster back. It’s not that Mr. Cooper necessarily set out to portray Mr. Bulger as a charismatic antihero whose actions are both appalling and exciting. (The screenplay by Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth is based on the book by the reporters Dick Lehr and Gerard O’Neill of The Boston Globe.) His protagonist, played by Johnny Depp and called Jimmy by most of his friends and associates, does terrible, unforgivable things, nearly all of which the real Mr. Bulger actually did. But the conventions of popular culture, conventions to which Mr. Cooper hews with slavish or perhaps unthinking devotion, treat those things with a certain reverence. This guy is evil, but you have to admit he’s also kind of cool. I’m not really raising a moral objection here. I have seen “Goodfellas” and the “Godfather” movies more times than I can count, and I’m as susceptible as any other deskbound, conflict-averse fantasist to the visceral appeal of a good gangster movie. But “Black Mass” isn’t one. Mr. Cooper’s direction is skillful, if overly reliant on borrowed Scorseseisms (especially when it comes to music), and the cast is first-rate, but the film is a muddle of secondhand attitudes and half-baked ideas. It feels more like a costume party than a costume drama. Mr. Depp, with sweptback silver hair, a dead front tooth and a grayish complexion offsetting icy blue eyes, gives Jimmy a vampirish air. He sips ginger ale from a bottle while his colleagues down shots and pints of beer, and speaks in a fierce whisper. He is nice to old ladies on the street, devoted to his mother and brother, and shows himself to be a doting (and then a grieving) father. The contradiction between this apparent soft side and his general disregard for human life feels less like an insight than like boilerplate, a cliché to set alongside the splattering of brains against car-window glass, the surprise whackings of guys who thought they were on their way to whack other guys, and the invocations of loyalty. Not to mention the scenes of men in suits slamming their hands on desks and yelling at one another. “Black Mass” pivots between the streets and bars of Southie and the F.B.I. offices at Government Center, where Jimmy’s boyhood pal John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) has set himself up as the scourge of the Italian mob while also serving as Whitey’s inside man. Mr. Edgerton’s hot-blooded strutting and shouting contrasts intriguingly with Mr. Depp’s chilly reserve, but Connolly remains a one-dimensional character, a garish bad apple in a barrel full of mostly honest but fatefully credulous lawmen. (His office mates and superiors are played by Kevin Bacon, Adam Scott and David Harbour as John Morris, who follows Connolly down Whitey’s rabbit hole.) transcript na The other side of the law is populated, as usual, by colorful thugs with rougher faces and thicker accents. (Hey, guys, can we give Boston a rest as a crime-movie backdrop, and maybe try Chicago for a while? I say this as a former resident of both cities and a longtime fan of the letter R.) The episodic narrative is framed by testimony from some of Jimmy’s former underlings, who turned on him when a new prosecutor (Corey Stoll) came to town. Jesse Plemons as Kevin Weeks, Rory Cochrane as Steve Flemmi and W. Earl Brown as the slow-moving hit man John Martorano are all credibly gamy and mean, and the matter-of-factness of their testimony is the best, most honest part of the movie. Benedict Cumberbatch plays William Bulger with a slyness that makes you wish “Black Mass” had delved deeper into the mysteries of blood and power. And the appearance, at the margins of the story, of Julianne Nicholson (as Connolly’s wife, Marianne), Dakota Johnson (as Lindsey Cyr, the mother of Jimmy’s son) and Juno Temple (as Deborah Hussey, a young victim of Whitey’s paranoia) exposes the limitations of the film’s angle of vision on the world its characters occupy. We’re in historically masculine genre territory, of course, but this movie’s collection of mothers, wives and mistresses is especially threadbare. More boilerplate. It’s possible, though, to think of the shortcomings of “Black Mass” as fitting comeuppance for Mr. Bulger. He may have thought he was a big deal, but in the end all he merits is a minor gangster movie.  “Black Mass” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Explosive profanity, exploding heads.","permanent guest federal government fugitive james bulger s boston notorious criminal brother william served president massachusetts senate james referred whitey disliked nickname ran winter hill gang vicious enterprise business delicacy enjoyed cozy relationship local office blind eye crimes exchange information activities rivals government informer meted lethal punishment suspected rats remorseless killer viewed folk hero fellow citizens sentimental son south boston brought drugs neighborhood story begs movie elements screen departed martin scorsese remake classic hong kong crime film incorporates aspects whitey bulger legend whitey joe berlinger solid documentary squarely victims families dispelling aura gangster romance surround white ethnic practitioners organized crime transcript black mass scott cooper film luster cooper necessarily set portray bulger charismatic antihero actions appalling exciting screenplay mark mallouk jez butterworth based book reporters dick lehr gerard neill boston globe protagonist played johnny depp called jimmy friends associates terrible unforgivable real bulger conventions popular culture conventions cooper hews slavish unthinking devotion treat reverence guy evil admit cool raising moral objection goodfellas godfather movies times count susceptible deskbound conflict averse fantasist visceral appeal gangster movie black mass isn cooper direction skillful overly reliant borrowed scorseseisms music cast rate film muddle secondhand attitudes half baked ideas feels costume party costume drama depp sweptback silver hair dead front tooth grayish complexion offsetting icy blue eyes jimmy vampirish air sips ginger ale bottle colleagues shots pints beer speaks fierce whisper nice ladies street devoted mother brother doting grieving father contradiction apparent soft disregard human life feels insight boilerplate cliché set alongside splattering brains car window glass surprise whackings guys whack guys invocations loyalty mention scenes suits slamming hands desks yelling black mass pivots streets bars southie offices government center jimmy boyhood pal john connolly joel edgerton set scourge italian mob serving whitey inside edgerton hot blooded strutting shouting contrasts intriguingly depp chilly reserve connolly remains dimensional character garish bad apple barrel honest fatefully credulous lawmen office mates superiors played kevin bacon adam scott david harbour john morris connolly whitey rabbit hole transcript na law populated usual colorful thugs rougher thicker accents hey guys boston rest crime movie backdrop chicago resident cities longtime fan letter episodic narrative framed testimony jimmy underlings prosecutor corey stoll town jesse plemons kevin weeks rory cochrane steve flemmi earl brown slow moving hit john martorano credibly gamy matter factness testimony honest movie benedict cumberbatch plays william bulger slyness makes black mass delved deeper mysteries blood power appearance margins story julianne nicholson connolly wife marianne dakota johnson lindsey cyr mother jimmy son juno temple deborah hussey victim whitey paranoia exposes limitations film angle vision world characters occupy historically masculine genre territory movie collection mothers wives mistresses threadbare boilerplate shortcomings black mass fitting comeuppance bulger deal merits minor gangster movie black mass rated requires accompanying parent adult guardian explosive profanity exploding heads"
"Seduction by Machine Gun","Michael Mann’s “Public Enemies” is a grave and beautiful work of art. Shot in high-definition digital by a filmmaker who’s helping change the way movies look, it revisits with meticulous detail and convulsions of violence a short, frantic period in the life and bank-robbing times of John Dillinger, an Indiana farm boy turned Depression outlaw, played by a low-voltage Johnny Depp. Much of what makes the movie pleasurable is the vigor with which it restages our familiar romance with period criminals, a perennial affair. But what also makes it more than the sum of its spectacular shootouts is the ambivalence about this romance that seeps into the filmmaking, steadily darkening the skies and draining the story of easy thrills. The thrills are certainly there in the sensationally choreographed prison break that opens the movie under a bright blue Midwestern sky that stretches across the wide screen like a cathedral ceiling. Dappled by fluffy white clouds, it is the kind of sky that tends to show up as a backdrop in paintings of the Madonna and Child, but here offers a sharp contrast to the long-distance image of Dillinger and his friend Red (Jason Clarke), quickly striding toward an enormous, looming prison. Mr. Mann goes in closer once the men enter the prison, where they help disarm the guards, and he pulls back again for the long view as Dillinger fires on the prison with a machine gun while the escapees make a run for the getaway car. By force of Hollywood habit, you might expect that this vision of the suddenly lone gunman would serve as a prelude to another exciting joy ride about living fast and dying young. Instead it’s followed by a striking short scene of a wounded escapee being dragged alongside the speeding car while Dillinger and another man struggle to pull him up. In the most startling shot, Mr. Mann places the camera right next to the fallen man, pointing it up at Dillinger’s dark, ominous figure as he almost blots out that blue sky. Dillinger holds on until the man’s grip wilts, the dead body slipping away in one direction as the car races off in the other. Laying the blame elsewhere, he next tosses another man out of the moving car. This, then, is Mr. Mann’s Dillinger: brave enough to stand his ground, loyal, ruthless. There’s a hint of the demonic in this portrait, particularly when the outlaw is gliding through a bank, his long, dark coat fanning around him and a tommy gun in one hand. This is the stuff of legends, of shoot-’em-ups and matinee gangsters with jaunty smiles. Mr. Mann loves this apparition of calculated bravura and initially he frames the first few heists as seamlessly choreographed set pieces. During the first robbery he shows Dillinger and two accomplices from high overhead, the camera peering straight down as the men fan across a black-and-white bank floor like MGM dancers. When Dillinger leaps across a railing, he soars. It’s a seductive moment <U+0097> the bad man seems to be defying gravity, not just the law <U+0097> and much like the other action scenes, it gives the movie a jolt. It also, perhaps in homage, mirrors a similar shot of the escaping serial killer in David Fincher’s “Seven.” Like Mr. Fincher, Mr. Mann makes big-budget art movies that because of their complex pleasures and ambiguities, don’t always hit the box office sweet spot (“Seven” and “Collateral,” Mr. Mann’s movie with Tom Cruise, being exceptions). Despite Mr. Mann’s mainstream bona fides, notably with the 1980s hit TV show “Miami Vice,” and preference for muscular cinematic genres, there’s something resolutely noncommercial about his movies. Among other things, they’re deeply serious (at times to the edge of parody), which is why they rarely pop. And “Public Enemies” is nothing if not serious, a vividly realistic if fictionalized portrait of a country deep in depression and jumping with bad men. The story centers on two dramatic antagonists, Dillinger and Melvin Purvis (a remote Christian Bale), the F.B.I. agent who doggedly, if often ineptly, led the hunt for America’s most wanted. At first the bureau’s young chief, J. Edgar Hoover (a terrific Billy Crudup, his neck thickened and delivery clipped), ignored Dillinger, deeming him a state problem. Hoover would have been spared embarrassment if the outlaw had remained out of federal jurisdiction because, when the chase was on, it was with agents who didn’t know how to conduct a stakeout or properly fire their guns. Like Dillinger, Hoover cultivated a public profile that looked good on paper and later up on the screen. They had a lot of competition. Bonnie and Clyde were running wild, as were Pretty Boy Floyd, Baby Face Nelson and other hoods with marquee-ready stories, some of whom make appearances here. Banks made for easy targets, logistically and otherwise, and, as the writer Bryan Burrough points out in a book about America’s inaugural war on crime, these outlaws took advantage of the public’s hatred of those recently failed institutions. Dillinger raided bank vaults and staged prison breaks to increasing approval. He shot one man to death, though didn’t always own up to the killing. It was bad for his image. He became another kind of America’s most wanted: a star. “Get me the money, Honey,” he instructed one female teller with his crooked smile. The press raised his profile with screaming headlines, and the comic Will Rogers joked about the ineptitude of the authorities. (They were going to shoot Dillinger, Rogers joked, but “another bunch of folks came out ahead; so they shot them instead.”) Mr. Mann, working with incidents drawn from Mr. Burrough’s “Public Enemies: America’s Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the F.B.I., 1933-34,” underscores the celebrity angle. But that’s only part of the big picture sketched out in his ambitious screenplay, written with Ronan Bennett and Ann Biderman, which also makes room for a love story amid the blazing guns and tabloid glory. The relationship between Dillinger and a hatcheck girl named Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard, holding her own in this man’s world) eats up considerable time, sometimes winningly, though both actors are better when they’re apart. When not in pirate drag, Mr. Depp can be a recessive, even inscrutable screen presence, which is crucial to his strengths and performative limits. He’s a cool cat, to be sure: veiled and often most memorable when he’s staring into space while the camera soaks in his subdued but potent physical charms. He might have made a great silent star, as earlier roles suggest. Part of his initial appeal was that he seemed almost Garboesque in a movie world that increasingly makes no room for sacred idols. Mr. Depp looks good as Dillinger <U+0097> few contemporary actors can wear a fedora as persuasively <U+0097> but the performance sneaks up on you, inching into your system scene by scene. The same holds true of “Public Enemies,” which looks and plays like no other American gangster film I can think of and very much like a Michael Mann movie, with its emphasis on men at work, its darkly moody passages, eruptions of violence and pictorial beauty. Mr. Mann’s digital manipulations, in particular, which encompass almost pure abstraction and interludes of hyper-realism, is worthy of longer exegesis, one that explores how this still-unfamiliar format is changing the movies: it allows, among other things, filmmakers to capture the eerie brightness of nighttime as never before. “Public Enemies” doesn’t look like the usual gangster picture, not only because it’s been shot in digital, but also because Mr. Mann is searching for a new kind of gangster story to fit the times, one that makes room for greater ambivalence, and lawmen and outlaws who are closer to one another in temperament and deed. If he doesn’t fully succeed, it’s because he knows that the gangster’s rakish smile is at once a fiction of cinema and one of its great, irresistible lies. During the big finish, Dillinger grins wryly at a black-and-white Hollywood picture with Clark Gable as the kind of gangster who could only have been invented by the movies, a gangster who is as false as the bullets that finally stopped Dillinger were real. “Public Enemies” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

"That Fire, Lighted and Doused","“He’s Hot, He’s Sexy and He’s Dead,” blared the cover line of a 1981 Rolling Stone article about the Doors’ Jim Morrison, 10 years after he died in a bathtub in Paris at 27. There was no autopsy. The same tinge of exploitation applies to “When You’re Strange: A Film About the Doors,” Tom DiCillo’s muddled, pretentious assemblage of film clips of the band shot between 1966 and 1971, with solemn narration by Johnny Depp. Much of the footage shows Morrison posing, preening, screaming and going crazy onstage. The Lizard King, as he was known, was a charismatic male pin-up strutting about in leather pants as he played a cheesy pre-punk Dionysus writhing to the band’s snake-charmer music. He was also faintly ludicrous, a sultry male Marilyn Monroe, pouting and puckering as he gazed at his own imagined reflection with lowered eyes. As Morrison deteriorated, the movie says, audiences were drawn as much to the spectacle of a madman onstage as to the Doors’ music. Mr. DiCillo’s script is a shallow hodgepodge of biographical tidbits about the Doors, larded with clichéd images of the 1960s that have been recycled hundreds of times. (Robert F. Kennedy’s assassination again?) The film begins and ends with eerie excerpts from “HWY,” a 1969 film in which Morrison is shown driving through the desert and hearing the news on the radio of his own death. (The broadcast was added to “When You’re Strange.”) It goes on to tell the story of how the Doors <U+0097> the lead singer and poet Morrison, the keyboardist Ray Manzarek, the guitarist Robby Krieger and the drummer John Densmore <U+0097> came together. “When You’re Strange” soon loses its train of thought and darts around in time, leaving you thoroughly confused about what happened and in what order and how events related to one another. We learn that Morrison was insecure about his singing; Elvis Presley, his original idol, was later superseded by Frank Sinatra. There is footage of the notorious Miami concert at which Morrison was arrested for exposing himself, although there is no photographic evidence that he actually did. The chaos he incited at that event is of the kind you don’t see at rock concerts nowadays. In retrospect the drug- and alcohol-related deaths of Morrison, Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix in 1970 and ’71 occurred at a moment when the road map charting the effects of the rock ’n’ roll lifestyle at its most extreme had yet to be drawn. Pioneers of the youth culture’s determination to test limits, all three were victims of an ignorant, widespread assumption that drugs consumed indiscriminately were shortcuts to enlightenment. By today’s standards, medical knowledge of addiction and of the body’s tolerance for drugs was sketchy; the concept of rehab had yet to enter the cultural conversation. Morrison followed a path that’s now well-trodden; he started out with psychedelics and ended up a burnt-out drunk. As a case study of a self-destructive performer consumed by his own mystique, he remains in a class by himself. “When You’re Strange: A Film About the Doors” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes strong language. WHEN YOU’RE STRANGE A Film About the Doors Opens on Friday in Manhattan.

"There’s a New Sheriff in Town, and He’s a Rootin’-Tootin’ Reptile","Feature animation currently finds itself in a golden age of mediocrity, with sensationally inventive technical means tethered, more often than not, to drab and cynical imaginative ends. The perennial Pixar exception tends to prove a dreary rule: as animated movies claim an ever bigger share of money and attention — drawing cross-generational, demographically diverse audiences more readily than most other films — they rely more and more on manic, synthetic formulas. And so, a half-dozen times a year, parents and children line up for overscaled, noisy genre pastiches crammed with yammering movie-star voice work, eye-straining action sequences and tacked-on sermons about the importance of being yourself, following your dream or sticking by your friends and family. Even at their best (again noting the Pixar exception), these movies are like theme-park rides and other big-ticket corporate amusements — thrilling while they last and then quickly forgotten. All of the above should apply to “Rango,” a tongue-in-cheek western (a lizard’s tongue, at that) directed by Gore Verbinski, who is best known for helping to turn a theme-park ride (Disney World’s “Pirates of the Caribbean”) into a dizzyingly successful movie franchise. But the odd thing about “Rango” is that unlike so many of its peers, it is odd. In spite of a profile that should place it alongside “Megamind” and “Despicable Me” and the long list of other overblown, have-fun-or-else cartoons, this rambling, anarchic tale is gratifyingly fresh and eccentric. Much of the time you don’t quite know where it is going, which is high praise indeed given the slick predictability that governs most other entertainments of its kind. Perhaps this should not be too surprising, since Mr. Verbinski, especially in the first installment of the “Pirates of the Caribbean” series, showed a distinctive visual style and a genuinely off-beat sensibility. He was helped immeasurably, in all of the “Pirates” pictures, by the decorative whimsy of Mark McCreery (the production designer here) and by the uninhibited goofiness of Johnny Depp, who turned Jack Sparrow into a new pop-culture archetype. Both Mr. McCreery and Mr. Depp are crucial to the look and rhythm of “Rango,” keeping it vigorously strange almost until the end, when the movie decides to go for the safe, commercial action-extravaganza wrap-up. But the craziness of the journey makes that familiar destination worth it. We first encounter Mr. Depp’s character, a domesticated lizard with a Hawaiian shirt and an active imagination, in the terrarium tank he shares with a broken doll torso and a wind-up plastic fish. This minimal world is a stage for him, and he struts about on it like a scaly provincial trouper, acting out dramatic scenarios and scenes from Shakespeare to dispel the boredom of benign captivity. The blank, abstract space this creature inhabits calls our attention to the fanciful nature of the movie itself, as it begins to conjure an antic, improbable world out of nothing. Or, rather, out of images and ideas that have been floating around in the collective dream life for as long as most of us can remember. Mr. Verbinski and his colleagues (John Logan wrote the script, and James Ward Byrkit shares story credit) rummage through a grab bag of allusions and homages, many of which seem inspired more by genuine fandom than by the impulse to be clever. There is an early, blink-and-you-miss-it nod to the memory of Hunter S. Thompson, who is a personal touchstone for Mr. Depp and is also connected to the iconography of the West that “Rango” sets out to explore. That includes not only the expected tumbleweeds and cactuses and dusty rock formations, but also a hallucinatory desert tradition encompassing Carlos Castaneda and Wile E. Coyote.  10 Photos View Slide Show › Prodded on his quest by a visionary armadillo (voiced by Alfred Molina) and accompanied by the corridos of a quartet of fatalistic singing owls, our reptilian hero drags himself to the desolate town of Dirt, a bleak, bone-dry place that is nonetheless swimming in cinematic associations. As Hans Zimmer’s score chews up great mouthfuls of Ennio Morricone-style spaghetti, the town’s varmint population evokes movies ranging from the westerns of John Ford to “Chinatown” and “The Big Sleep.” I know, it sounds annoyingly, coyly referential — something like a lizard-cowboy “Shrek” — but the spirit is closer to those old Bugs Bunny cartoons in which Bugs would cross paths with real movie stars or perform Wagnerian opera. In other words, it is not self-conscious knowingness that drives “Rango” but rather a quirky and sincere enthusiasm for all the strange stuff that has piled up in the filmmakers’ heads over the years. Nor are they merely recycling. The desert environment has a washed-out, eerie appearance entirely unlike the plasticized landscapes of most animation — the great cinematographer Roger Deakins, who shot the American West for Joel and Ethan Coen in “No Country for Old Men” and “True Grit,” is credited as a visual consultant — and the critters who inhabit it are arrestingly, grotesquely hairy, slimy and scaly. In addition to the reptile there are an impressive assortment of birds, bugs, rodents and less identifiable species that collectively enact a story of greed, treachery and bravery as old as the West itself. Our lizard, a stranger in town, takes on the name Rango and finds himself appointed sheriff, and also romantically drawn to a plucky frontier gal named Beans (Isla Fisher). (Abigail Breslin, Ray Winstone and Harry Dean Stanton are among the other notable voices of Dirt.) The town is drying up, and the mayor (Ned Beatty) may not have the best interests of the citizens at heart. A whole lot happens, culminating in a showdown with a villainous rattlesnake (Bill Nighy) and including a voice cameo that I won’t spoil, though the end credits might. Those interested in narrative coherence may feel a bit let down at the end; I confess I wanted a tighter gathering of loose ends, and a more thorough explanation of the politics of water and real estate in the fast-changing American West. But that’s what real westerns are about. “Rango,” which may take place entirely within its hero’s head — that kind of ambiguity worked in “Inception” and “Black Swan,” so why not here? — is about the appetite for myths and stories, whether or not they make sense. It is about the worlds we dream inside our fishbowls, helped by the weird reflections on the walls. “Rango” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). There’s rude talk, smoking and killing. It is a western, after all. RANGO Opens on Friday nationwide.

"Whale Oil Explodes and Buccaneers Bellow","It is fitting that what passes for a plot in “Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides” involves a search for the fountain of youth. This film, the fourth in a series that made its improbable and profitable leap from the theme park to the multiplex eight summers ago, represents an attempt to rejuvenate a flagging franchise. Whether the effort was absolutely necessary is both an obvious and a naïve question. Why would the Walt Disney Company, which distributes these movies, and Jerry Bruckheimer, who produces them, ever want to leave well enough alone? In Hollywood, gratuitous excess — not necessity — is the mother of invention. Not that “On Stranger Tides” is especially inventive. Gore Verbinski, who directed the first three installments with wanton energy, rococo visual flair and a flagrant disregard for narrative coherence, has been replaced by Rob Marshall, who specializes in turning well-loved pieces of popular art (“Chicago,” “Memoirs of a Geisha,” “Nine“) into tedious, literal-minded prestige movies. So while this picture is called “On Stranger Tides,” it is by far the least strange of all the “Pirates” episodes so far, with none of the cartoonish exuberance or creepy-crawly effects that made its predecessors intermittently delightful. Mr. Verbinski, whose sensibility owes more to the naughty, anarchic Warner Brothers and MGM cartoons of the 1940s and ’50s than to the Disney tradition, made a successful transition to full-blown animation with “Rango,” which featured Johnny Depp as a lizard out of water. Mr. Depp, returning as Jack Sparrow in “Tides,” is very much in his aqueous, mischievous element, and he shows admirable professionalism in a project that often seems more like a rock-band reunion tour than a blockbuster movie sequel. A lot of the original cast members and special guest stars have fallen away — Keith Richards shows up for a minute or two, less thrillingly than the last time — but the guys up front are still in good shape, and a few more old-timers have been recruited from elsewhere to add their seasoned chops. Richard Griffiths has a fleshy, wiggy cameo as King George, and Judi Dench appears briefly as a lady in a carriage, but the movie belongs to the power trio of Mr. Depp, Geoffrey Rush (as his sometime nemesis Barbossa) and Ian McShane, who brings a floridly sinister death-metal-meets-“Deadwood” vibe to the role of Blackbeard. Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom are hardly missed, as the filmmakers — Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio are the credited screenwriters — wisely turn the movie over to the gamy supporting players. There are a pair of young people in love, one of them a missionary (Sam Claflin), the other a mermaid (Astrid Bergès-Frisbey), but their wooing is incidental to the mugging and bellowing and occasional swordplay among Sparrow, Blackbeard and Barbossa. It’s almost as if a “Harry Potter” movie had dispensed with Harry, Ron and Hermione and devoted itself to documenting a meeting of the Hogwarts faculty. But the name Jerry Bruckheimer in the opening titles mean that things must explode — a huge tank of whale oil, most memorably — and that there must be chases, crashes and leaps through the air. With an early exception involving a cream puff and a chandelier, these action sequences are handled more as instances of duty than occasions for play. And I almost forgot to mention the 3-D, for good and bad reasons. The good one is that the format is mostly unobtrusive: you barely notice it unless a sword is sticking out of the screen or Penélope Cruz is moving toward the camera. Ms. Cruz, who starred with Mr. Depp in “Blow“ about 10 years ago, plays a former and possibly future flame of Jack Sparrow’s named Angelica, who may or may not be Blackbeard’s long-lost daughter.  6 Photos View Slide Show › “On Stranger Tides” never lives up to — or, for that matter, does anything to deserve — the recent parody tribute offered by Michael Bolton in a “Saturday Night Live” digital short, which emphasizes exactly the insouciant pop spirit that has slowly drained out of the “Pirates” juggernaut from one film to the next. It lives on in a few bon mots, and in a spooky, sexy sequence involving mermaids, whose pert, smooth tails are the only memorable piscine digital innovations on display here. But like “Thor“ — which is, all in all, not quite as boring — “On Stranger Tides” is protected from the consequences of its own mediocrity by the mere fact that it is opening in thousands of theaters on Friday. People will go, and more energy will be expended parsing the box-office returns than discussing the merits of the film, which is likely to be judged entertaining enough and therefore, in the end, not much fun at all. “Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Some fantasy-horror violence. PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: ON STRANGER TIDES Opens on Friday nationwide.

"What’s a Nice Girl Doing in This Hole?","Into the dark you tumble in “Alice in Wonderland,” Tim Burton’s busy, garish and periodically amusing repo of the Lewis Carroll hallucination “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.” It’s a long fall turned long haul, despite the Burtonian flourishes <U+0097> the pinch of cruelty, the mordant wit <U+0097> that animate the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) and the porker that slides under her feet with a squeal. “I love a warm pig belly for my aching feet,” the queen tells Alice. Played by Mia Wasikowska, Alice looks a touch dazed: she seems to have left her pulse above ground when she fell down the rabbit hole of Mr. Burton’s imagination. Mr. Burton has done his best work with contemporary stories, so it’s curious if not curiouser that he’s turned his sights on another 19th-century tale. Perhaps after slitting all those throats in his adaptation of “Sweeney Todd,” he thought he would chop off a few heads. Whatever his inspiration, he has tackled this new story with his customary mix of torpor and frenzy. After a short glance back at Alice’s childhood and an equally brief look at her present, he sends the 19-year-old on her way, first down the hole and then into a dreamscape <U+0097> unfortunately tricked out with 3-D that distracts more than it delights <U+0097> where she meets a grinning cat and a lugubrious caterpillar, among other fantastical creatures. Dark and sometimes grim, this isn’t your great-grandmother’s Alice or that of Uncle Walt, who was disappointed with the 1951 Disney version of “Alice in Wonderland.” “Alice has no character,” said a writer who worked on that project. “She merely plays straight man to a cast of screwball comics.” Of course the character of Carroll’s original Alice is evident in each outrageous creation she dreams up in “Wonderland” and in the sequel, “Through the Looking-Glass,” which means that she’s a straight man to her own imagination. (She is Wonderland.) Here she mostly serves as a foil for the top biller Johnny Depp, who (yes, yes) plays the Mad Hatter, and Mr. Burton’s bright and leaden whimsies. First thought up by Carroll in a rowboat in which one of the passengers was the 10-year-old Alice Liddell, the object of his much-debated love, “Wonderland” (1865) is, among many other things, a testament to glorious nonsense as well as an inspiration for dark thoughts (about Carroll’s feelings for Liddell) and for lysergic works from the likes of David Lynch. It’s a total (head) trip, one that starts and stops and doesn’t fit easily into the mainstream narrative mold, which could explain why the screenwriter Linda Woolverton, borrowing both from “Wonderland” and “Through the Looking Glass,” has given Alice a back story, a dash of psychology and a battle royal if, alas, not a pool of her own tears in which to swim. Since narrative momentum isn’t Mr. Burton’s strength, “Alice in Wonderland” probably seemed a good fit for him, and there are moments when his transparent delight in the material lifts the movie and even carries it forward. His Wonderland (here, Underland) isn’t inviting or attractive. The colors are often bilious, though the palette also turns gunmetal gray, bringing to mind “Sweeney Todd.” There’s a suggestively nightmarish aspect to Alice’s journey, as when she steps on some severed heads in the Red Queen’s moat as if they were stones. The queen herself is a horror: Bette Davis as Elizabeth I and reconfigured as a bobble-head doll. Ms. Bonham Carter makes you hear the petulant child in her barbarism and the wounded woman too. She rocks the house and the movie. And she does, even though the character is a harridan cliché who, smitten with her knave (Crispin Glover) and clutching her power, rules with a boom. (“Off with his head!”) She eventually dukes it out with her rival and sister, the White Queen (Anne Hathaway, gliding like an ice dancer), who enlists Alice’s help. There’s more, including computer-generated flowers, assorted 3-D projectiles and the usual British actors earning their pay, like the “Harry Potter” alumni Timothy Spall, Alan Rickman and Imelda Staunton. Mr. Burton lavishes his attention on the little things in “Wonderland” <U+0097> the perfectly drawn red heart painted on the center of the Red Queen’s mouth, for instance <U+0097> perhaps because nothing else claims his attention. He’s very bad with the awkward action scenes, maybe because he’s embarrassed that they even exist. Mr. Depp’s strenuously flamboyant turn embodies the best and worst of Mr. Burton’s filmmaking tendencies even as the actor brings his own brand of cinematic crazy to the tea party. With his Kabuki-white face, the character seems to have been calculated to invoke Heath Ledger’s Joker, though at his amusing best the Hatter brings to mind a strung-out Carrot Top. But Mr. Depp doesn’t have much to do, which he proves as he wildly flirts with the camera. The only time the character hooks you is in the shivery moment when his gaze turns predatory as he looks at Alice, who, every inch a Tim Burton Goth Girl, from her corpselike pallor to her enervated presence, presents a more convincing vision of death than of sex. That queasy, potentially rich and frightening moment expectedly fades as fast as the Cheshire Cat (Stephen Fry), which doesn’t leave you with much else to hold onto, Alice included. Mr. Burton’s heroine is a wan figure to hang an entire world on, and Ms. Wasikowska, who’s a livelier, truer presence in the forthcoming “The Kids Are All Right,” barely registers among Mr. Burton’s clanging and the computer-generated galumphing. This isn’t an impossible story to translate to the screen, as the Czech filmmaker Jan Svankmajer showed with “Alice” (1988), where the divide between reality and fantasy blurs as it does in dreams. It’s just hard to know why Mr. Burton, who doesn’t seem much interested in Alice, bothered. “Alice in Wonderland” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It is a surprise (or not) that this movie, with its severed heads and Jabberwocky battle, is not rated PG-13, which serves as a warning for parents. ALICE IN WONDERLAND Opens on Friday nationwide.

"'Pirates of the Caribbean': Eat My Jetsam, Davy Jones","AT first glance, it seems like a pretty good deal. You put down your money — still less than $10 in most cities — and in return you get two and a half hours of spirited swashbuckling, with an all-star three-way battle of the cheekbones (Orlando Bloom vs. Keira Knightley vs. Johnny Depp) and some extra-slimy computer-generated imagery thrown in at no additional cost. But there's a catch, as there usually is. ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" is not just a movie. It's a glistening, sushi-grade chunk of franchise entertainment, which means that maximal enjoyment of it comes with certain obligations. It is the second episode in what will be at least a trilogy — the third installment is scheduled for release next summer — and full appreciation of its whirligig plot will depend on thorough acquaintance with the first ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" picture, conveniently available for purchase on DVD. And since ""Dead Man's Chest"" brazenly dispenses with the convention of an ending — it's pretty much all middle — you will, by virtue of buying that ticket, have committed yourself to buying another one a year from now if you're the least bit curious about how the whole thing turns out. By then, chances are good that you will have forgotten most of what happened in ""Dead Man's Chest,"" so you'll have another disc to add to the shopping cart. The question is: Is it worth it? The same thought probably crosses the minds of Disney theme-park vacationers as they endure endless lines for the ride on which the movies are based, but the notion is quickly banished because nobody likes to feel like a sucker. By a rational calculation of time and money — yours and the untold millions invested by Disney, the producer Jerry Bruckheimer and others — the answer is probably no. But hey, this isn't about that, right? It's about fun. You're there to have fun. Fun for the family. Fun for the kids. Fun for everyone. So shut up and have fun. And you probably will, even if it's hard to shake the feeling that you've been bullied into it. Gore Verbinski, the director, has an appropriate sense of mischief, as a well as a gift, nearly equaling those of Peter Jackson and Steven Spielberg, for integrating CGI seamlessly into his cinematic compositions. What is curious about the recent crop of high-tech blockbusters is how seriously they take themselves, and unlike, say, ""Superman Returns,"" ""Dead Man's Chest"" cannot be called pretentious. It makes no claims to being about good and evil, the difficulty of saving the world in the modern era, or the inner lives of any of its characters. Instead, it sends Elizabeth Swann (Ms. Knightley) and Will Turner (Mr. Bloom), their wedding day ruined in an opening sequence that seems to pay tribute to the old Guns N' Roses ""November Rain"" video, on a search for the pirate captain Jack Sparrow (Mr. Depp). Jack, as usual, finds himself in all kinds of trouble, pursued not only by agents of the British crown, but also by an undead, squid-faced mariner, the famous Davy Jones, who commands a ghoulish crew of half-human, half-aquatic creatures. These sailors are like the cast of ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" — or the menu at a seafood restaurant —come to life: Night of the Living Bouillabaisse. One of them, played by Stellan Skarsgard with a starfish embedded in his face, is Will's long-lost father, a development that adds a gelatinous morsel of father-son pathos to the stew of plots and subplots cooked up by the screenwriters, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio. Davy Jones himself, meanwhile, speaks in the sinister whisper of Bill Nighy, though it is his swaying mass of facial tentacles that most viewers will remember. And there are other memorable bits and pieces, visual highlights of a movie with no particular interest in coherence, economy or feeling. Ms. Knightley is, once again, a vision of imperial British pluckiness, with an intriguing dash of romantic recklessness that surfaces toward the end. Mr. Bloom, as is his custom, leaps about, trying to overcome his incurable blandness, and is upstaged by special effects, musical cues, octopus tentacles and pieces of wood. Naomie Harris turns up for a few scenes of hammy voodoo, and Mackenzie Crook and David Bailie contribute some proletarian slapstick. Most of the other members of the first movie's cast show up again, sometimes in surprising circumstances. The franchise, of course, belongs to Jack Sparrow, and to Mr. Depp. Because this is a sequel, the role is no longer the splendid surprise it was in 2003, when ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" charmed audiences and disarmed critics on its way to the third-best domestic box-office gross of the year. But the best parts of ""Dead Man's Chest"" confirm Jack Sparrow as the most viable Disney cartoon character in quite some time, though his anarchic insouciance has more in common with the work of Chuck Jones or Tex Avery. Mr. Verbinski, for his part, grasps the kinship between today's computer-assisted filmmaking and the hand-drawn animation of old, which lies in the freedom to revise the laws of physics at will. Two sequences in particular stand out, and would stand alone nicely as shorts: I will always think of them as ""Fruit Kebab"" and ""Runaway Hamster Wheel."" But the easy delight that such flights of visual fancy inspires is crowded and blocked by all the other stuff going on in this long, ungainly movie, which for all its busy, buzzing parts, is incapable of standing on its own. It batters you with novelty and works so hard to top itself that exhaustion sets in long before the second hour is over. By next summer, I suppose, we'll all be rested and ready for more. ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some violent action scenes, and a few moments of gruesome creepy-crawly movie horror.

"ARIZONA DREAM (MOVIE)","The 1992 film ""Arizona Dream"" arrived on the home video market with traffic-stopping credits and a badly checkered past. Starring Johnny Depp and Faye Dunaway long before the more staid (believe it or not) ""Don Juan DeMarco"" made the world safe for that pairing, it also features Jerry Lewis, Lili Taylor, Michael J. Pollard and Paulina Porizkova. Not to mention an arrowtooth halibut, a set of homemade flying machines and various sled dogs, who play prominent roles in the characters' reveries. As do the crop-duster sequence from ""North by Northwest"" and a willful red balloon. ""Arizona Dream"" was directed by the Bosnian film maker Emir Kusturica (""When Father Was Away on Business""), who apparently intended it as a festive, 2-hour-and-22-minute delirium about, among other things, American enterprise. Pink Cadillacs and pink flamingos are among its other visual motifs; Mr. Lewis wears a lot of pink and is made a walking symbol of go-getterism. He could have been an easy target, but he's appreciated in ways that accentuate this film's unexpected generosity, its greatest virtue. Even so, Mr. Kusturica had no idea what he was up against where American enterprise was concerned. In pointless attempts to market ""Arizona Dream"" for middle-of-the-road audiences, his film was shrunk down to two hours and jettisoned by its American distributor, Warner Brothers. Though it did passable business in Europe, ""Arizona Dream"" has taken three years to reach a movie theater in New York. It finally opens today at the Film Forum, which has gamely resurrected the full-length version. ""Did I really make a film that they couldn't even release?"" Mr. Kusturica asked rhetorically two weeks ago, only hours before he won his second Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival (for ""Underground""). No, but he didn't exactly make it easy. In its clumsily truncated form, adapted to video dimensions that butcher the director's wide-screen compositions, ""Arizona Dream"" verges on the demented, impervious to any conventions of cookie-cutter film making. But even at its full length, showing off a more seductive rhythm and the buoyant humanism that is this director's calling card, it remains as ripe a subject for therapy as for criticism. What works best for ""Arizona Dream"" is that its lunacy is so liberating. Mr. Kusturica often favors a broad, rowdy mess over anything more structured, but he can galvanize his actors in captivatingly weird ways. Ms. Dunaway hasn't seemed this girlish since she was a girl. (She's supposed to be playing the one bona fide nut in the film, but that's a fine distinction.) Mr. Depp, no stranger to risky roles, this time cheerfully wears a white skirt around his neck while imitating a chicken. Ms. Taylor sits and plays the accordion with scene-stealing ferocity, and has no trouble explaining that she'd like to be reincarnated as a turtle. There may be a few too many verses of ""Besame Mucho"" in the background while all this unfolds, but restraint is not on anyone's mind. In this slapstick psychodrama with a heavy dash of magical realism, Mr. Depp plays Axel Blackmar, the principal dreamer. He lives in New York, fervently imagines Alaska and winds up in Arizona at the behest of his uncle, Leo Sweetie (Mr. Lewis), who wants to do him a favor. Leo thinks he can save Axel from a life of fish counting (that's what he does for a living, working for the Department of Fish and Game) by making him a car salesman. But Axel cares about fish with this film's brand of passion: ""Sometimes I'll look straight into a pair of fish eyes and I'll see my whole life. That's something only fish can show us, and I love 'em."" Once Axel winds up beached in Arizona, Mr. Kusturica is armed with more of the things only fish can show us, and he eagerly piles them on. Axel hooks up with Paul (Vincent Gallo), who's movie-mad enough to parrot some of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino's best-loved lines and to mimic the ""North by Northwest"" crop-dusting scene as a stand-up comedy act. (Try to imagine that.) He's also drawn in by both Elaine (Ms. Dunaway) and Grace (Ms. Taylor), a mother and stepdaughter. The women's rivalry surfaces during a dinner-table scene involving strangulation by pantyhose and a live turtle. Don't ask. If you're in the right mood -- the same kind of last-gasp 3 A.M. mood in which Mr. Kusturica and David Atkins, who wrote the screenplay together, may have concocted this mad mixture -- then ""Arizona Dream"" has enough patterns and parallels to hold interest, even if it successfully avoids all traces of reason. It may be necessary to be an arrowtooth halibut to follow it further. Working on unfamiliar terrain, without the ballast of Bosnian history that gives such heft to ""Underground,"" Mr. Kusturica meanders along at an obvious disadvantage. Even so, his ""Arizona Dream"" is enjoyably adrift, a wildly off-the-wall reverie. It's more than a fish out of water.

"Astronaut's Wife, the (Movie)","''The Astronaut's Wife'' arrived yesterday in a veil of mystery. How could a thriller starring Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron be so bad that New Line Cinema, which has been in no hurry to release this film, would not risk screening in advance for the press? Answer: as directed by Rand Ravich, it's actually a lot better than these circumstances suggest. But as written by Mr. Ravich, a screenwriter directing his debut feature, ''The Astronaut's Wife'' is ridiculously derivative. Perhaps no one has told the exact story of an astronaut who experiences two minutes' worth of strangeness in space and then comes home seeming, well, different. But when his wife, Jillian (Ms. Theron), becomes pregnant, it hardly seems coincidental to find her in Mia Farrow's hairdo from ''Rosemary's Baby.'' Ms. Theron's role in the much sharper ''Devil's Advocate'' was another variation on that theme. Showing off an underutilized film noir sensibility, Mr. Depp plays Comdr. Spencer Armacost, who is one part NASA and two parts Elvis. (''They gon' be pilots, honey,'' he drawls sexily, when told that Jillian is expecting twins.) Spencer is one of two crew members who are nearly killed while on a mission, and the other (Nick Cassavetes) flips out soon after returning to Earth. Spencer is also madly in love with his wife, which the film emphasizes avidly. ''Hey, Jill, what are you wearing?'' he asks, when NASA lets him telephone her in mid-flight. You and I and creatures in other galaxies can guess why Spencer begins behaving peculiarly later on. But Mr. Ravich gives the film a clean, sensuous look and tarts it up stylishly, doing what he can to deflect attention from the obvious direction in which the story is headed. While many of his flourishes are effective and visually interesting, he also indulges in plenty of overkill. When Jillian (abetted by Joe Morton as a NASA renegade) is upset by an audiotape and angrily destroys it, the incinerator's-eye view of the tape being thrown away is more than we need to know. Mr. Depp moves through the film suavely and imperturbably, never letting the particulars bog him down. He bats not an eye when Spencer moves to New York and becomes a corporate executive, for instance, although the details don't even presume to make sense. He and Ms. Theron, looking cherubically beautiful, establish a warm rapport that would seem more natural if the film had anything else to offer. And as for -- oops! -- the aliens, their designs on the Armacosts prove to be awfully tepid. This film's answer to the question of whether there is intelligent life elsewhere in the universe: not too. ''The Astronaut's Wife'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes strong language and erotic encounters. THE ASTRONAUT'S WIFE Written and directed by Rand Ravich; director of photography, Allen Daviau; edited by Steve Mirkovich and Tim Alverson; music by George S.

"Back to the Bounding Main","“The immaterial has become material,” announces the East India Company’s scheming Lord Beckett (Tom Hollander) early in “Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End.” He could be referring to the recent resurrection of the pirate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), flush with life and his expanded role in the trilogy. Or he could be speaking of his newfound dominion over the Flying Dutchman and its squid-faced captain, Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), whose excavated heart is now in Beckett’s possession. More likely, though, the words are a subliminal reassurance from the director, Gore Verbinski. After the bloated shenanigans of the previous entry, “Dead Man’s Chest” — perhaps the only pirate movie to see the need for a Ferris wheel — Mr. Verbinski is reminding us why we should ever trust him again. This third and perhaps final episode in the swishy, swashbuckling saga goes some way toward achieving that goal. The cannibals, coconuts and landlocked locations have been replaced by the high-seas high jinks that made the first film so enjoyable. And the palpable relief as the myriad plotlines rush toward some semblance of resolution has made everyone quite giddy; even our passion-deferred lovers, Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann (Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley), appear marginally less bored with each other. Or at least less bored than we are with them. Filmed sequentially with its predecessor, “At World’s End” is less concerned with ends than inversions, presenting a society where the lawless practice democracy and their rulers engage in tyranny. The crown has declared a state of emergency, civil rights have been suspended, and naysayers are lined up to be hanged. In one of the film’s most bizarre sequences, the condemned begin to sing, belting out a dirge among the rolling tumbrils and swaying nooses. (Tardy audience members may think they’ve stumbled into a performance of “Les Misérables” by mistake.) The song reaches Elizabeth, in a skiff heading for the Pirate Brethren Court in Shipwreck Cove, and for a while the movie becomes a watery opera with a distinctly Oriental flavor. By the time Chow Yun-Fat appears, as the grumpy pirate lord Sao Feng — complete with an entourage of old-Hollywood coolies — the Gilbert and Sullivan vibe is beginning to wear. After electing Elizabeth pirate king (the Brethren know who wears the trousers in this trilogy), the pirates set out to clobber the British before Davy Jones and his seafood-combo crew can do the same to them. This will require the help of the priestess Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris), whose role has clarified but whose diction remains unintelligible. “Therr is a cahst to be ped en thah end,” she warns mysteriously, mangling her vowels like a voodoo version of Inspector Clouseau. Having blown Tia up to Godzilla size, however, the screenwriters, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, have no further use for her; in her new incarnation as the sorceress Calypso she amounts to little more than crabs and raging wind. Considering she is afforded only one conjugal visit every 10 years —and that from a man who breathes through a blowhole — her bad temper is entirely understandable. But what of Johnny Depp’s Capt. Jack Sparrow? Following his unfortunate encounter with a giant cephalopod at the end of the last movie, this one finds him trapped and hallucinating in Davy Jones’s Locker, an arid limbo of rolling dunes and raging heat. Because he is Jack, his hallucinations are all about himself (the real love affair in these movies has always been between Jack and his mirror), and Mr. Verbinski fills the screen with an army of mincing clones in kohl eyeliner and fancy head scarves. Forever above the fray and beside the point, Mr. Depp’s devilish buccaneer is the lightfooted device that holds the franchise together; as he sashays from battle to bar, impervious to insult and musket alike, Jack’s very narcissism is his protection. He’s an inverse superhero. Though the film is filled with the expected special-effects wizardry, its most stunning and surreal moments are also the most peaceful: an army of crabs transporting the Black Pearl over dunes and into the ocean, and a flaming sunrise viewed through tattered seaweed sails. A disappointing cameo by Keith Richards, still alive and flaunting the look of hard-won dissipation that reportedly inspired Jack’s personal style, is in a special-effects category of its own. Perhaps he should have rented a copy of “Performance” and taken notes from Mick Jagger. Because of the abundance of unpleasant human characters, all of whom lie, cheat and betray one another at the drop of a flounder, the burden of creating an emotional connection with the audience must be borne, ironically, by characters whose humanity has long since evaporated. From the pathos of Davy — still playing the organ like an invertebrate Phantom of the Opera — to the tragic yearning in the barnacle-encrusted face of Bootstrap Bill Turner (Stellan Skarsgard), “Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End” reminds us that great acting can transcend even the most elaborate makeup. Even so, if the story is to continue, its creators will need more than Jack’s limp wrists and Will’s limp resolve. In the prophetic words of Barbossa, “There’s never a guarantee of comin’ back, but passin’ on — that’s certain.” “Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has scary battles, scary monsters and even scarier rock musicians. PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN At World’s End Opens tonight nationwide.

"Before Night Falls (Movie)  ","Julian Schnabel's film ''Before Night Falls'' belongs to what might be called the life-is-but-a-dream school of biographical cinema in the way it hovers ethereally over its subject and conjures up fragments of his consciousness in brilliant, disconnected flashes. Adapted from a memoir by the exiled Cuban poet and novelist Reinaldo Arenas, this haunting film portrays that homosexual dissident writer as a desperate unfulfilled searcher for a lost heaven on earth that he experiences only briefly as a very young man. No sooner has he tasted the ecstasies of this pagan paradise than it is snatched away by the punishing, gray-faced Communist revolution. Relentlessly persecuted for being gay and for having his manuscripts smuggled out of the country and published abroad, Arenas eventually migrated to the United States along with thousands of other Cubans during the 1980 Mariel boatlift. But if exile brought him freedom, it provided little satisfaction. After living unhappily in Miami for a time (the film omits this period) Arenas settled in New York, where he committed suicide in 1990. (He was suffering from AIDS.) In his suicide letter he bitterly blamed Fidel Castro for all his troubles, including his death. For all the pain and disappointment it encapsulates, ''Before Night Falls'' is far from a glum film. Like a deathbed dream it leapfrogs through Arenas's life, reconstructing crucial moments as a succession of bright, feverish illuminations. The movie, which the New York Film Festival is showing this evening and on Sunday at Alice Tully Hall, makes little attempt to psychoanalyze Arenas or to explain him. Instead it dips into his imagination, plumbing the sources of his art in scenes that evoke his closeness with nature and his obsession with sex. Javier Bardem, the gifted Spanish actor who portrays Arenas (and who bears a striking physical resemblance to him) narrates the film (whose screenplay incorporates swatches of Arenas's posthumously published 1993 memoir) in a thickly accented English that is occasionally difficult to follow. The portrait it paints is of a slightly mad romantic who never recovers from the dashing of his illusions. Freedom for Arenas didn't simply mean freedom of political expression; it was synonymous with his being a wild boy who claimed to have had 5,000 sexual encounters by age 25. When the Communist revolution on which he had pinned his inchoate boyhood hopes clamped down on Cuba's free-for-all sexual climate and threw homosexuals in prison camps, Arenas began to throw a lifelong tantrum. Liberation wasn't supposed to bring repression. The film's early scenes of Arenas's dirt-poor childhood in Oriente province, where he was brought up by a single mother and his grandparents, are dizzyingly gorgeous, surreal evocations of a sopping semi-jungle environment where he played in mud holes and carved his early poems into trees. Childhood memories of torrential floods rushing across the landscape have a kind of a voluptuous majesty, and as Arenas matures, the movie returns again and again to images of water. His happiest moments are his days spent lolling on the beach in male company and having indiscriminate sex everywhere and with everyone. One of his first boyfriends, Pepe (Andrea Di Stefano), a handsome bisexual stud and heartbreaker (who later betrays him), is held up as Arenas's erotic ideal, a rampantly priapic force of nature. In these scenes the film deliciously evokes pre-Castro Cuba as a sensual endless summer of hot pliable flesh and lapping turquoise waters. Later, when Arenas escapes from prison, he steals out of his cell, squeezes through a fence, and dives into the ocean. Later still, in an unsuccessful attempt to flee Cuba, he floats out to sea on an inner tube. While still a boy, the film recalls, Arenas desperately wanted to join the Communist guerrillas, and it skillfully weaves period color film clips of the revolutionary celebration with similarly grainy original scenes. No wonder then that when the revolution, which he had naively equated with personal salvation, repressed homosexuals and artists, he became its bitter, unforgiving enemy. ''Before Night Falls'' skips lightly over Arenas's persecution and imprisonment. Thrown into an overcrowded jail teeming with murderers and rapists, he earns respect (and cigarettes) by writing letters for his illiterate fellow prisoners. In the most nightmarish scene he is thrown into solitary confinement in a cell, lighted with a single hissing bulb, that is so cramped he is unable to stand up straight. Johnny Depp has flashy dual cameo roles as a transvestite who smuggles Arenas's rolled-up manuscripts out of prison and as a prison guard who uses sexual manipulation to secure Arenas's signature on a statement declaring his own writing to be worthless. Once the film moves to New York, its colors dim, as though all the light had gone out of Arenas's life. As he becomes ill, he is dutifully attended by his companion Lazaro Gomes Garriles (Olivier Martinez). Long before Arenas kills himself (with pills and a plastic bag), his will to live appears to be spent. One of the movie's final and most resonant scenes intercuts images of the slums of New York with the grand but now crumbling architecture of contemporary Havana. ''Before Night Falls'' is a larger, more emotionally sweeping film than Mr. Schnabel's 1996 movie debut, ''Basquiat.'' But like its predecessor it is essentially a painter's movie. Despite its copious narration, it often feels as if the words of the screenplay were scrawled onto the canvas as an afterthought. Like many of Mr. Schnabel's paintings, this cinematic canvas is consciously heroic in its scale. Yet ''Before Night Falls'' is mercifully neither hagiographic nor politically strident. And for all the brutality Arenas endured in his life, the movie is surprisingly gentle and free of jarring shocks. If ''Before Night Falls'' doesn't give us Arenas's life as he actually experienced it, it offers penetrating glimpses into his life as he may have dreamed it. BEFORE NIGHT FALLS Directed by Julian Schnabel; written by Cunningham O'Keefe, Lazaro Gomez Carriles and Mr. Schnabel, based on the autobiography of Reinaldo Arenas; directors of photography, Xavier Perez Grobet and Guillermo Rosas; edited by Michael Berenbaum; music by Carter Burwell, with additional music by Lou Reed and Laurie Anderson; production designer, Salvador Parra; produced by Jon Kilik; released by Fine Line Features.

"Beware of Amish Hitmen and the Anxiety of Influence","If a movie requires the lead actor to spend a good chunk of his onscreen time talking to himself and Popeye is unavailable because of contractual disputes, it's hard to do better than Johnny Depp. His performance as the trebly beset writer Mort Rainey is the highlight of the underwhelming ''Secret Window,'' which opens nationwide today. This movie is a suspense thriller whose only suspense comes from an audience wondering if the picture will hit its promised 97-minute running time. ''Secret Window'' dramatizes the plight of Mort, who is suffering from writer's block. This was triggered by the tumultuous break-up of his marriage to Amy (Maria Bello) and the protracted divorce proceedings. The writer and director, David Koepp, stages the events leading to the end of Mort's marriage so well that most of what follows is a letdown. And what follows is Mort, who now lives in a remote cabin, sleeping his way through a depression until a thunderous knock at the door rouses him from a sofa almost as lived in as his bathrobe. He hauls his blond-tipped bedhead to the door, where he encounters John Shooter (John Turturro), which brings up Mort's Misery No. 3. Dressed ominously in a big-brimmed black hat and a work shirt buttoned to the neck -- he looks like an Amish hitman -- Shooter drawls menacingly, ''You stole my book.'' Groggy and astounded, Mort is confronted with the evidence: Shooter's short story reads exactly like Mort's best-selling murder mystery ''Secret Window.'' And worse, Shooter gives Mort three days to set things right, or else. Much of the plot turns on Mort's getting his hands on a copy of Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine to prove that he published his story before Shooter wrote his version. And on Mort's need to be home when the phone rings. In other words the film takes place in a charming little seaside town without cellphones, Internet access or a library; sadly, given the current state of affairs, only the last is not so improbable. ''Secret Window'' was adapted by Mr. Koepp from Stephen King's novella ''Secret Window, Secret Garden.'' Mr. King's name is noticeably absent from the advertisements for the movie; given that the ABC miniseries ''Kingdom Hospital'' comes from the mind of Mr. King -- sort of -- this novelist's name must be as frightening to Columbia Pictures, which is releasing the film, as the Beatles' lawyers are to Danger Mouse. ''Window'' has been opened up to let too much air into the room, and the sluggish pacing will allow even the drowsiest viewer to keep up with the story. A number of amusing little clues turn up, involving some snappy gestures from Mr. Depp. And the director abets the mischief by planting a copy of Tom Robbins's farcical magic-realism novel ''Villa Incognito'' in plain view. Timothy Hutton plays Ted, the other man/other menace. (Amusingly, his dad, Jim Hutton, played Ellery Queen in an old series and would have wrapped things up before the trailer ended.) And Charles S. Dutton gives a gentle authority to the role of Mort's bodyguard. Pale and disheveled, Mr. Depp rolls through the film in a wardrobe that looks as if it has been slept in, the kind of believable physical detail that never gets costume designers Oscar nominations because it's far too real. What little intrigue the movie has comes from Mort's shattered self-esteem; he asks himself if he really was capable of stealing Shooter's story, vowel for vowel. Unfortunately, such a concern may not mean a whole lot to viewers. Then again, neither will the rest of ''Secret Window,'' which has the vague plotting generally found in an anthology horror-show episode. It's the kind of thing that's fine for about 20 minutes, before your attention kicks in, or nods off. ''Secret Window'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has violence, strong language, sexuality and enough blood to cover a school of red herrings. SECRET WINDOW Directed by David Koepp; written by Mr. Koepp, based on the novella ''Secret Window, Secret Garden'' by Stephen King; director of photography, Fred Murphy; edited by Jill Savitt; music by Philip Glass; production designer, Howard Cummings; produced by Gavin Polone; released by Columbia Pictures. Running time: 97 minutes. This film is rated PG-13. WITH: Johnny Depp (Mort Rainey), John Turturro (John Shooter), Maria Bello (Amy Rainey), Timothy Hutton (Ted Milner), Charles S.

"Blow (Movie)  ","Johnny Depp has the kind of face that justifies the existence of cinema. You would have to go back to the young Montgomery Clift, or perhaps to Greta Garbo herself, to find facial bone structure so perfectly suited to the shimmering subliity of the screen. Yes, Mr. Depp is a gifted actor, but his talent for dramatic understatement is sometimes overwhelmed by his sheer charisma. Though he makes even dull films watchable -- you can't take your eyes off him -- his enigmatic reserve can make everyone else look like a shameless ham. When he's paired with a first-class Actors Studio emoter like Al Pacino (in Mike Newell's ''Donnie Brasco'') or Marlon Brando (in Jeremy Leven's ''Don Juan DeMarco'') the effect can be electrifying. But when, in Ted Demme's new film ''Blow,'' he stands by as Penelope Cruz throws a coked-out hissy fit, you feel a little embarrassed for both of them. Mr. Depp's sorrowful countenance is the still point at the center of ''Blow's'' swirling hyperactivity, and his witty, spare performance gives the picture a poignancy -- a depth of feeling, if you'll allow the pun -- that Mr. Demme's hectic direction and the hurried script by David McKenna and Nick Cassavetes don't quite earn. Mr. Depp plays George Jung, a real-life drug dealer now serving a long sentence in a federal prison, whose aged, haunted face comes onscreen at the end of the picture. (In the sad final scenes, Mr. Depp's prettiness is submerged in prosthetic jowls and painted-on liver spots.) Though it ends on a bleak note of betrayal and defeat, ''Blow'' is neither a tragedy nor a morality play, but rather a jaunty, candy-colored romp through a quarter century or so of American pop music, pop fashion and popular illegal substances. The early scenes -- shot in the grainy, faded tones that signify the pinched old days before everything was groovy -- show George's working-class childhood in Weymouth, Mass. Witnessing his parents' endless squabbles over money and his father's humiliating bankruptcy, George -- pronounced ''Jawdge'' in Mr. Depp's fastidious regional dialect -- resolves never to be like them and flees to Manhattan Beach, Calif., a town populated entirely by airline stewardesses. (The year is 1968, so they are not yet flight attendants and not yet emancipated from Playboyesque stereotyping.) George and his pal Tuna (Ethan Suplee) hook up with a local hairdresser (Paul Ruebens, avidly dusting off another period stereotype, the flamboyant gay coiffeur), who also happens to be the town's main pot supplier. Before long the enterprising George, using his stewardess girlfriend Barbara (Franka Potente) as a courier, is running a lucrative transcontinental dealership. When demand outruns supply, he cuts out the middleman and heads for Mexico, where, after some initial suspicion of a gringo going around asking, ''Donde esta el pot?'' the local growers are amazed at how quickly he can move their product. But after a brief spell of blissed-out hedonism, George's luck turns sour. As soon as his voice-over proclaims that ''everything was perfect,'' Mr. Demme cuts to a dark interior, and George's parents (Ray Liotta and Rachel Griffiths) show up to accentuate the negative. Barbara becomes ill, and George is busted after his pursed-lipped mother (maybe it's the accent, which Ms. Griffiths struggles with) rats him out. ''It's for your own good,'' she says, which turns out to be true. In prison, her son meets an ingratiating Colombian named Diego (Jordi Molla), who introduces him to the lucrative and dangerous world of the nascent cocaine cartels. The recent trend in movies about drugs -- exemplified by ''Traffic'' and ''Requiem for a Dream'' -- is toward a solemn reckoning of their social and psychological costs. ''Blow,'' with its jaunty visual style, short-attention-span editing, and outlaw-entrepreneur story line, takes a considerably lighter view. If the earnest, ambiguous ''Traffic'' worried about the insatiable American hunger for illegal pleasures, the breezily nonjudgmental ''Blow'' celebrates this appetite and makes those who exploit it into hip folk heroes. Pundits will no doubt scowl that the movie tolerates -- or even glorifies -- the use of marijuana and cocine, but to raise such an objection is to miss the point. ''Blow'' is only superficially about drugs. Like most American vice epics, from ''The Godfather'' to rap videos, it's really about money and the fabulous set and costume design opportunities it can buy. On two different occasions, and in two different languages, ''Blow'' has characters utter the oft-repeated movie-gangster creed, ''It's nothing personal, just business.'' The main problem with ''Blow'' is that it swings ambivalently between these two poles, breezing through George's rags-to-riches chronicle with such light-handed exuberance that it never establishes the emotional density that would make its sad final act work. George's marriage to a cartel princess named Mirtha (Ms. Cruz) never generates the on-screen heat (despite a swirling, fancily edited montage of their first encounter) that would explain its ultimate combustion. Mr. Demme's storytelling is quick and engaging, but also a bit lazy: the clothes and Mr. Depp's inscrutable countenance do much of the work. The outfits, haircuts and sunglasses, it must be said, are as dazzling and evocative as the soundtrack, which opens with the Rolling Stones' ''Can You Hear Me Knocking'' and includes thematically appropriate cuts by Lynyrd Skynyrd, Bob Dylan, and K. C. and the Sunshine Band. But the extravagant precision of George's wardrobe -- from wraparound shades to aviator frames, from turtleneck sweaters to Members Only jackets -- amounts to a stylistic shorthand that substitutes for historical insight rather than contributing to it. ''Blow'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has profanity, a few scenes of violence and many scenes of drug use.

"DEAD MAN (MOVIE)","Dead Man,"" Jim Jarmusch's sardonic nightmare vision of the Old West, begins with a display of grotesquerie that is so sensational it sets up expectations that the movie might be the surreal last word on the Hollywood western and its mythic legacy. Those expectations, unfortunately, are not fulfilled. The film's energy begins to flag after less than an hour, and as its pulse slackens it turns into a quirky allegory, punctuated with brilliant visionary flashes that partially redeem a philosophic ham-handedness. Audiences attuned to Mr. Jarmusch's drolly hip sensibility should be delighted with the film, but to the uninitiated, its drier patches are just as likely to induce yawns. This story of a young man's passage through a frontier crawling with violence, death and decay begins on a train whose soot-faced fireman (Crispin Glover) delivers an ominous prediction. Appearing in the car where William Blake (Johnny Depp), the film's protagonist, is playing solitaire, he warns Blake that when he reaches his destination, the town of Machine, he will find his own grave. As the train hurtles westward, Blake, incongruously duded up in a floppy bow tie and checkered suit, finds himself surrounded by silent, gun-toting geezers with wizened faces. Peering out the window, he sees the tattered remains of abandoned covered wagons and other signs of decay. When the train passes a buffalo herd, his fellow passengers clamber to the windows with rifles and blindly open fire. Machine turns out to be a rutted backwater hellhole dominated by the Dickinson Metalworks, the company that is supposedly going to employ Blake as an accountant. But on showing up at the place, he is informed by the leering office manager (John Hurt) that the post has been filled. When he confronts the owner, John Dickinson (Robert Mitchum), he is ordered at gunpoint to leave at once or else he will soon be ""pushing up daisies."" Stranded and nearly penniless, Blake visits a bar where he meets Thell Russell (Mili Avital), an attractive woman who takes him back to her shabby rented room strewn with paper flowers she has made. While they're in bed together, Thell's distraught former boyfriend, Charlie Dickinson (the company owner's son, played by Gabriel Byrne), appears and shoots at Blake but kills Thell instead. Blake shoots Charlie with Thell's gun, and jumps out a window, but not before he himself is critically wounded. Blake suddenly finds himself a fugitive with a bullet in his chest and a bounty on his head. From here, the movie changes from a horrifying evocation of the frontier into something more problematic and self-conscious. Pursued by bounty hunters and law officers, Blake makes his way westward until he reaches the Pacific, leaving a trail of carnage behind him. For much of the way he is accompanied by a gruff, facetious Indian guide named Nobody (Gary Farmer), who has dressed his wounds and believes his companion to be the reincarnation of the English poet William Blake. When Nobody tells his story, it turns out that he, too, is a sort of fugitive. Captured as a boy by white men, he was taken East and exploited as a sideshow attraction and from there to England, where he was educated and discovered Blake's poetry. The Indian appoints himself the poet's guide back into the spirit world. When ""Dead Man"" succumbs to its own allegorical pretensions, it becomes a slogging philosophic exercise whose dialogue never comes close to matching the energy of its malevolent characters and the novelty of its visual images. Shot in black-and-white, the movie beautifully sustains a vision of the West as wild in the most primal and scary sense of the word. Its talk is another matter. Mr. Jarmusch's screenplay has Nobody address Blake in a joking profanity-laced slang that has a sly contemporary ring. That dialogue is right in tune with Neil Young's jangling, scraggly electric guitar score, which twangs portentously on the soundtrack. The clash between the film's two styles has little resonance. The movie picks up a new flash of energy and humor whenever a weird new character stumbles into view. Some of its livelier moments focus on an eccentric trio of hired killers, the meanest of whom (Lance Henriksen) is rumored to have raped both his parents and eaten them. Equally intriguing are a trio of animal skinners whom Nobody and Blake happen upon as they are eating beans around a campfire. The oddest of the three (Iggy Pop) is a gaunt old hunter dressed in pioneer-lady drag who regales his comrades with the story of the Three Bears. When ""Dead Man"" is imagining the Wild West as an infernal landscape of death, it is furiously alive. When it tries to reflect on those images, it begins to nod out. ""Dead Man"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has profanity and violence.

"Donnie Brasco (Movie)  ","There's a great little moment in the gangster film ''Donnie Brasco'' that shows Al Pacino preparing to meet the Godfather. Fine, we've seen that before. But this Mr. Pacino is different: aging, weary, drab, down on his luck though desperately eager to please. Trying to put his best foot forward, he stands dutifully amid a crowd of low-level Mafiosi. The boss walks by without giving him a look. It's a sharp, clever encounter, overturning all manner of genre cliches and viewer expectations. And the crackling good ''Donnie Brasco,'' the best crime movie in a long while, is full of similar surprises as it leads Mr. Pacino and Johnny Depp through a fine-tuned tale of deception. Surprise No. 1: Mr. Depp's tremendous talent is no longer surprising. With this film his career reaches critical mass, turning an assortment of varied, offbeat roles into the trajectory of a major star. Mr. Depp is not alone in being in the right place at the right time with ''Donnie Brasco.'' It's also an affirmation that the director, Mike Newell, has a gift for talkative, intelligent films that make his actors shine. Whether in sunny Italy (''Enchanted April''), mystical Ireland (''Into the West''), nuptial-mad England (''Four Weddings and a Funeral'') or now in the tacky realm of the American gangster, Mr. Newell can make the most out of tartly fine acting and good conversation. (His last film, ''An Awfully Big Adventure,'' failed miserably because its backstage theatrical milieu, arch tone and English accents traveled badly. It's worth a second look.) ''Donnie Brasco'' is also a boon to Mr. Pacino, who brings such color and pathos to a story that automatically invokes the breadth of his own career. Whether in the mob (you know where) or undercover (''Serpico''), he has been here before as the brash young man, and now he graduates to the kind of senior status that is a character actor's field day. A whole world of second thoughts about the gangster's game can be found in the small strokes of his performance here. And Mr. Pacino's reward for passing a generational torch to Mr. Depp is the chance to team up with a young actor on the same wavelength. These two stars have such good, macho chemistry that their scenes together really shoot off sparks. As Donnie Brasco, a man who doesn't exist, Mr. Depp turns tough so easily and charismatically that it's easy to forget he was ever Gilbert Grape or Edward Scissorhands. Donnie is actually Joe Pistone, the undercover F.B.I. agent who infiltrated the Bonnano family in the late 1970's and upon whose memoir Paul Attanasio's screenplay is based. (Mr. Attanasio, who wrote ''Quiz Show,'' is also in fine form.) Donnie's initial mission is to befriend Lefty Ruggiero, the over-the-hill hit man played by Mr. Pacino with a mixture of regret and indignation over his career progress. ''Twenty-six guys I clipped,'' Lefty complains. ''Do I get upped? No, they pass me by!'' The first meeting between Donnie and Lefty sets the tone for the long, artful two-man exchanges that separate this mob movie from the many others it resembles. In a bar, Donnie pretends to be a jewel expert and convinces Lefty that the new diamond Lefty just bought is fake. Without further ado Lefty scoops up Donnie, takes him to a different joint and confronts the seller, whom Donnie roughs up as a matter of mob etiquette. Before leaving with the seller's car in tow, Donnie stuffs some money in the man's mouth to pay a bar bill. ''Why'd you pay for that drink, Don?'' Lefty asks paternally. ''Wise guys never pay for a drink.'' ''You know something?'' Donnie soon boasts, when he meets F.B.I. agents in a place the mob would never look (a kosher restaurant). ''I got him. I got my hooks in the guy.'' But it's the other way around. Lefty begins fouling up the plan by welcoming and instructing Donnie as his surrogate son, since Lefty's real son is no good. And Donnie grows increasingly fond of the irresistible Lefty. But the undercover man also knows, throughout ''Donnie Brasco,'' that Lefty will be the one to pay the price for Donnie's treachery when the F.B.I. scam is eventually exposed. That prospect gives the film dramatic tension, as does the threat that Donnie's new mobster friends will catch him in a lie. There are well-timed bubbles of suspicion that deliberately stop the story, which otherwise has all the rowdy wise guy color that its genre requires. Michael Madsen (just right as an imposing new boss), Bruno Kirby and James Russo are the other gang members closest to Lefty and Donnie, and they share the small-time ethos that gives the film its distinctive flavor. Even when -- especially when -- these guys strike it big and go from Brooklyn to Florida, they have no class. In one funny throwaway, they show up looking sporty in favorite loud polyesters and wind up in a melee on the tennis court. Mr. Newell may not have been at home in Brooklyn, but he is certainly enough of a humorist and anthropologist for this. Mr. Depp moves through the film with a brand-new hardboiled grace to give it heat, and a more familiar conscience-stricken sensitivity to keep it interesting. Anne Heche does well with what could have been the thankless role of Joe Pistone's wife, who is left to mind three children and shovel snow for months at a time while Joe is busy being Donnie Brasco. One quick, impassioned visit is all this character-driven film needs to show why these two are still married. But as an added bonus, they are seen visiting a counselor together. Donnie is not exactly inclined to let a jargon-spouting therapist tell him what to do. Like all gangster films, ''Donnie Brasco'' finally runs into unwelcome reality, turning cruel and bloody in ways that leave audience sympathy in the lurch. In the end it's a sordid and deadly story. But along the way, it's full of life. ''Donnie Brasco'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or guardian). It includes violence, profanity and one very brief sexual situation.

"ED WOOD (MOVIE)","""Ed Wood,"" Tim Burton's very good film about a very bad film maker, has a cheerful defiance that would surely have appealed to Orson Welles, who was Ed Wood's hero. Late in the film, Welles appears (played deftly by Vincent d'Onofrio, who really looks like him) to advise Wood that independence is everything and that an artist's visions are worth fighting for. Mr. Burton, currently Hollywood's most irrepressible maverick, has taken that credo to heart. So here is the Z-movie ethos of Edward D. Wood Jr., as filtered through the dark wit and visual brilliance of Mr. Burton. Two questions immediately present themselves: Who and why? To answer the first, Ed Wood was a director working on the outermost fringes of Hollywood in the 1950's. He made the kind of science-fiction film that used Cadillac hubcaps for flying saucers. He's best remembered for the transcendent tackiness of ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" and for ""Glen or Glenda,"" which achieved midnight movie notoriety for its story about a man who loved wearing angora sweaters. Ed Wood played that role himself, and he played it from the heart. Even allowing for the special ineptitude of the Wood oeuvre, or for Wood's habit of turning up in full drag to do his directing, it would take more to explain Mr. Burton's fascination with this subject. Wood was also a dauntless guerrilla film maker, assembling his own band of outsiders as a stock company and using anything or anyone he could commandeer for the film-making process. His daring deserves to be legendary: he made films on a shoestring, raised funds by hook or by crook, and really did steal a fake octopus for use in a scene with Bela Lugosi, who had to wrestle with the thing in a shallow pool of water (as depicted in ""Ed Wood""). He also lovingly resurrected the aging Lugosi, rescuing him from oblivion just as Mr. Burton rescues Ed Wood today. Ed Wood eventually descended into terminal sleaze, drinking himself to death, writing books with titles like ""Death of a Transvestite Hooker"" and making hard-core porn like ""Necromania,"" which depicts oral sex in a coffin. So the biggest surprise about ""Ed Wood"" is that it manages to be a sweet, sunny mainstream comedy, with its kinkiness reduced to the level of a joke. There is, for instance, the moment when Ed Wood's girlfriend, Dolores Fuller (Sarah Jessica Parker), asks: ""Where's my pink sweater? I can never seem to find my clothes any more."" Angora-loving Ed Wood (Johnny Depp) says nothing but looks guiltily at the camera. Mr. Depp isn't best known as a comic actor, but he gives a witty and captivating performance, bringing wonderful buoyancy to this crazy role. He captures all the can-do optimism that kept Ed Wood going, thanks to an extremely funny ability to look at the silver lining of any cloud. "" 'The soldiers' costumes are very realistic,' "" he exclaims early in the film, reading aloud the nicest line in a review of one of Wood's plays. ""That's positive!"" ""Ed Wood"" has devilish fun revisiting the scenes of Wood's many cinematic crimes, depicting with glee and accuracy the horrible conditions under which his films were made. George Weiss (Mike Starr), who distributed Wood's films in extremely out-of-the-way places, gives the director a motto of sorts when he says: ""Shoot whatever baloney you want. Just make sure it's seven reels long."" And Ed Wood himself, happily exclaiming, ""That was perfect!"" after any bad shot, is seen directing his cast in typical laissez-faire fashion. ""You're upset -- no, no, you're not that upset,"" he tells an actor who accidentally walks into a door. ""Ed Wood"" is in love with bad-movie high jinks, and with nutty, improvisatory film making as an antidote to the antiseptic slickness of today. But its real heart is in the Wood-Lugosi friendship. The aging vampire star, played with hilarious crankiness by an outstandingly fine Martin Landau, becomes a poignant figure even at his most bizarre. (Early in the film, Lugosi is seen at home in full cape and regalia, watching ""Dracula"" on television and holding a chihuahua in each hand.) Through all the humor about Lugosi's histrionics, and through pathos about his drug addiction, Mr. Burton's respect and admiration are unmistakable. When it comes to respect, ""Ed Wood"" pays homage with loving re-enactments of authentic Wood movie scenes and with actors who look uncannily like members of Wood's freakish troupe. (A closing credit notes that Tor Johnson, the bald, hulking wrestler played here by George ""The Animal"" Steele, achieved ""greatest fame as a best-selling Halloween mask."") Though the real Wood scenes looked starkly awful, ""Ed Wood"" is an unobtrusively gorgeous black-and-white film (expertly shot by Stefan Czapsky, Mr. Burton's usual fine cinematographer) with a wide range of striking visual effects. If ""Ed Wood"" has a major failing, it's the lack of momentum. Wood's career had nowhere to go, and to some extent the film (written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, based on Rudolph Grey's enterprising biography of Wood) has the same problem. Still, Mr. Burton has no trouble holding his audience's attention with incomparable Wood antics like the group baptism of his ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" cast. That film's financing came from the Baptist Church of Beverly Hills and church officials insisted on both baptism and the removal of ""Grave Diggers"" from the original title. One cast member is John (Bunny) Breckinridge, played by a delightfully demure Bill Murray in a suit, lipstick and pearls. Mr. Murray's slyest moment comes during the filming of ""Plan 9,"" when he wonders whether he ought to wear antennas on screen. ""No!"" exclaims Ed Wood. ""You're the ruler of the galaxy! Show a little taste."" ""Ed Wood"" is to be shown tomorrow at 9 P.M. and midnight as part of the New York Film Festival. It opens commercially in New York and Los Angeles on Wednesday. ""Ed Wood"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes mild profanity and wild cross-dressing.

"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (Movie)  ","In the teeming lobby of a Las Vegas hotel, the face of a woman behind the reservations desk warps, her features spilling across her face like a clown mask. As the camera pans around the plush, dimly lighted room crowded with hard-shelled tourists sipping cocktails, they suddenly turn into a sinister convention of lizards smacking their lipless mouths and casting conspiratorial glances. Conversations decompose into animalistic growls while the bland piped-in voice of Robert Goulet singing ''My Love Forgive Me'' remains eerily unaltered. This scene, drawn from one of many uproarious tableaux in ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,'' Hunter S. Thompson's brilliant, ranting explosion of verbal psychedelia, has been transferred to the screen by Terry Gilliam with a fidelity to the author's hallucinatory imagery that until now seemed impossible to capture in a film. But here it is in all its splendiferous funhouse terror: the closest sensory approximation of an acid trip ever achieved by a mainstream movie and the latest example of Mr. Gilliam's visual bravura. Why then should this gaudy splat of a movie, which is so scrupulously respectful of its source, convey so little visceral energy that when it's over you may feel like shrugging your shoulders? Revisiting Mr. Thompson's 1971 book, the enthusiastic full-tilt stamina of the author's alter ego, Raoul Duke, and his lawyer and partner-in-mayhem, Dr. Gonzo, is still infectious in its dated way. As they roar through Las Vegas like a pair of runaway trains, nothing derails them, even when the surrounding landscape seems to shatter into ghoulish hallucinatory shards. The drugs they consume by the fistful seem to work as physical as well as psychic fuel for their outrageous drug-addled investigation of the garish side of the American dream at a moment when the world seems divided into two mutually hostile camps: the insolent hip and the grimly square. But in the movie, the story of how Raoul (Johnny Depp) and his sidekick (Benicio Del Toro) travel to Las Vegas to cover a motorbike race for Sports Illustrated and get phantasmagorically sidetracked has been so rigidly compressed that its vignettes all bleed together into an overstuffed cinematic hodgepodge that adds up to far less than the sum of its parts. Yes, the details are accurate. But where the book conveyed a spirit of open-ended adventure in which each new caper could be spun out into its own little movie, the film rarely gives the book's appallingly funny anecdotes room to breathe. The film is clumsily anchored in a narration (by Donald Morrow) whose mock-heroic tone is faithful to the self-caricaturing attitude of Mr. Thompson's reportorial alter ego. But hearing this voice in the fragmentary spiels that are used to splice scenes together is a far different experience from hearing it shouting and guffawing uninterruptedly in your head as you read the book. Without that voice relentlessly goading you with the speed-rapping intensity of a great stand-up comedian on a roll, one scene after another in the movie falls flat. Even the most precise cinematic realizations of Mr. Thompson's images (and of Ralph Steadman's cartoon drawings for the book) don't begin to match the surreal ferocity of the author's language. The motorbike race barely registers. The depiction of a national convention of district attorneys veers uncertainly between grotesque satire and ineffectual parody. Dr. Gonzo's perilous relationship with Lucy (Christina Ricci), an underage teen-ager peddling her awful drawings of Barbra Streisand, becomes an unfocused throwaway bit, its paranoia diluted. In the strongest scene, which comes late in the film, Dr. Gonzo insults a waitress (Ellen Barkin) in a greasy spoon who quickly regrets standing up to him. Brandishing a knife, the lawyer reduces the poor woman to a speechless, quivering wreck. The scene is ugly enough to cast a moral shadow over the preceding fun and games and make you dislike these selfish rampaging hipsters who have spent the best part of the movie stoned out of their gourds, trashing hotel rooms and intimidating the help. Outfitted in tinted aviator glasses and an array of safari hats, a cigarette continually dangling from his lips, Mr. Depp, who has been made partly bald for the role of Raoul, turns in a clever stunt performance. But because a different actor narrates the story, Mr. Depp's largely nonverbal role seems more like a pantomime than a three-dimensional portrait. Mr. Del Toro's Dr. Gonzo is a more substantial performance in its transcendently boorish way. In one of the grossest scenes, the stoned-out, gun-waving ''attorney'' wallows in a garbage-filled bathtub like an enraged baby elephant roaring and snorting incoherently and threatening Raoul's life. Now of course we all know how the ''hip'' drug culture of the 60's and 70's deteriorated into a crack epidemic that devastated America's cities and destroyed countless thousands of lives. While the movie keeps the book's most lyrical riff, a nostalgic, incense-heavy evocation of the euphoric vibes of San Francisco in the heady days of hippie culture, the movie doesn't make the mistake of attempting a full-scale reconstruction of the myth of ''hip.'' But in refusing to cling to the book's quaint cocksure attitude, the film really has no attitude at all. For all of Mr. Thompson's intimations of the failure of the drug culture to save the world, his book still promoted a righteously hip us-against-them agenda in which the Rolling Stones, Buffalo Springfield and Janis Joplin were the cheerleaders for the good guys. And the Las Vegas version of the American dream (and the sanitized kitsch culture of the Lennon Sisters, Perry Como and Debbie Reynolds singing ''Tammy'' that was its sunnier aspect) was the enemy. As we all know now, it was never that simple. ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has scenes of drug-taking and strong language.

"From Hell (Movie)  ","The opening of the Hughes Brothers' film ''From Hell,'' a heady snort of paranoia about the trail of terror left by Jack the Ripper, gets its tone not only from the mordant graphic novel by the writer Alan Moore and the artist Eddie Campbell but from a surprising source: Sergio Leone, the Italian director. ''From Hell'' is shot in the wide-screen expanse that he favored. The movie is bracketed with a plot device lifted from Leone's ''Once Upon a Time in America'': the detective, Inspector Abberline (Johnny Depp), is flat on his back in an opium den, inhaling a transporting hookah of the stuff. Ashen and stricken, Abberline exhales murky plumes of smoke as his head fills with visions of mayhem. This is how he tracks down the killer; through a verdant haze, he sees the victims as they're being slaughtered. This scene is the filmmakers' first big departure from the comic book, which begins with a revealing epilogue. This twist gives the film a jolt of moviemaking power. It is one of the many ways that the directors, the twins Allen and Albert Hughes, find to complement, and then top, the apocalyptic narrative weaving that Mr. Moore is best at. (He wrote such entertaining nightmares as ''The Watchmen,'' with essentially the Justice League of America starring in the Book of Revelations.) The directors set the stage by plunging their camera's focus from the rooftop of a building down to the cobblestone bowels of London's streets (in this case sublimely evoked through Prague locations and re-creations of the city). They put us on the express elevator to the netherworld with dizzying quickness. ''From Hell'' -- its title comes from a phrase in a taunting note penned by the Ripper to the police -- is also extraordinarily violent, in addition to being one of the most breathtaking leaps of directing skills I've seen in years. It follows the dogged investigation of Abberline and his partner, Sergeant Godley (Robbie Coltrane), in trying to stop the bloody carnage by the East End's most famous criminal. Jack the Ripper stalks a group of prostitutes, and the streets teem with life and misery as the women struggle to make enough money to keep them safe from the extortionate muscle of the Nichols Street Gang. So many knives are bared that it's nearly impossible to tell who may actually be Jack the Ripper. Although Abberline's pursuit points him toward the Nichols Gang, there is the possibility that the unusual precision of the killer's knife is the product of an educated mind. Sir William Gull (Ian Holm), a physician and confidant of the royal family, takes an interest in Abberline's work and tries to help. And Abberline takes an interest in the independent-minded Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), the copper-haired prostitute who tries to keep the group of women together while their ranks are meticulously thinned by the Ripper. The movie succeeds, but it does have its faults -- the attempt to weld social melodrama and suspense creaks at some of the joints. But the Hughes Brothers' goal here is to make an epic of savagery, and they are brilliant at ambience and details. Like Mr. Moore, the Hughes Brothers are interested in large-scale paranoid fantasies, though they work closer to the real world. Although a period film set in late-Victorian London might initially seem outside their purview, what else is the Jack the Ripper tale but a tableau of urban violence, filled with characters who don't know where to turn? The tale is the European antecedent of the Hughes Brothers' ''Menace II Society'' and ''Dead Presidents.'' ''From Hell'' comes with voluminous footnotes, in which Mr. Moore cites ''Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution,'' a grim compilation of facts by Stephen Knight. Yet movie aficionados may recognize the plot from the 1979 suspense-shocker ''Murder by Decree,'' which suggests a conspiracy linking a high-born British nobleman to the Ripper. In ''Murder,'' Sherlock Holmes is set loose after Jack, and he is led to places that send shivers through his hound's-tooth deerstalker. What ''From Hell'' offers is a sensual trek, in which the directors display a loamy elegance that alarms as much as the arterial sprays from the victims. The cinematographer Peter Deming supplies a palette of grays, blacks and muddy browns that are alleviated by not only many shades of red -- at one point, even the nocturnal cloud cover is tinged with crimson -- but also a wealth of greens. Mr. Deming brings these colors together near the end for a promise of hope. But the greens also spell danger, like absinthe green as Abberline prepares a drug-filled cocktail unlikely to appear in an ad for Absolut. Abberline then sets the mix aflame, and downs it. The detective has to keep his head in the clouds to deaden his pain. (It's as if Abberline, in relentlessly chasing the dragon, is picking up the drug habits of Holmes that Sherlock wasn't allowed in ''Murder by Decree.'') ''From Hell'' is so beautifully realized as a mood piece that it takes a while for a slight disappointment to register. The movie isn't as scary as you'd like it be, and the mix of its elements don't quite take. And frankly, a movie is bound to be unsettling if its subject matter includes a monarchy that deemed prostitutes expendable and a society steeped in class consciousness and racism, despite the smart adaptation of Mr. Moore's chilly original by Terry Hayes and Rafael Yglesias. Ms. Graham's prostitute is nearly as detached as Mr. Moore is; she also struggles with the accent, which slips away from her at times. The rest of the cast gives the movie life. The Hughes Brothers could certainly have done worse than Robbie Coltrane -- this comic talent who took his surname from the improvisational sax genius registers with his own genius, and his burly, mussed soulfulness is a gift from heaven for the movie. Mr. Holm's pearly empathy sits well, too, and there is fine work from many of the other supporting actors. Mr. Depp, taking on a role with surface similarities to his leads in ''Sleepy Hollow'' and other recent films, makes Abberline a tormented man of action, soaked in every mind-altering substance available. He wants to keep his head in the clouds but is compelled to divine the truth. Part of the movie's drollery is that Mr. Depp is probably prettier than the hookers he is questioning, and that his need to play against his looks is so strong that it translates into a separate undercurrent of ferocity. (His comic skills are almost as spirited as Mr. Coltrane's.) He's game, as are all the elements in ''From Hell,'' a conspiracy-theory thriller with brains and a heart. ''From Hell'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for all the elements a Jack the Ripper story might suggest: violence, rivers of blood, strong language, nudity and drug consumption by the hero.

"Lost in La Mancha (Movie)","It's been said that it takes just as much work to make a bad movie as a good one; the HBO making-of-a-movie reality series ''Project Greenlight'' showed not only that the road to hell was paved with good intentions, but also that Satan's contractors were taking bids on the job. After watching the fascinating and compelling new documentary ''Lost in La Mancha,'' you may forever wonder how it is that movies are made at all. ''Lost'' may not be a great piece of filmmaking, but it is a great story; its directors display dramatic intelligence. ''Lost'' is an inside view of how a film, Terry Gilliam's ''Man Who Killed Don Quixote,'' can fall to pieces even under the guidance of a master director. It's a 180-degree spinout from ''Greenlight,'' a voyeuristic tale in which a neophyte filmmaker mortgages his soul to see his dream come true, only to have fate -- and an insidious crew and producer -- undermine him. What's clear and astonishingly entertaining about ''Lost'' is that the directors Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe's only good luck was that they happened to be safely behind the scenes when epic mishaps struck so often on the set that Beelzebub probably put in for overtime. Imagine watching a real-life version of Ian McKellen's kindly, indomitable Gandalf in ''Lord of the Rings'' give his life for his cause, only to find that his supreme gesture is meaningless because his fellows are slaughtered, anyway. That's what ''Lost'' is like. The wizard under siege in this montage of misadventures is Mr. Gilliam (''Jabberwocky,'' ''Time Bandits''), whose constant blinking suggests that more ideas are firing inside his massive skull than his mind can contain and that he's flinching from all the fireworks. The directors of ''Lost,'' which opens today in New York and Los Angeles, were given unlimited access to Mr. Gilliam as he was making his film, an adaptation of ''Don Quixote'' that was one of his dream projects. They had previously followed him as he made ''12 Monkeys,'' an adaptation of a short by the avant-experimental director Chris Marker. For ''The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,'' Mr. Gilliam persuaded Johnny Depp to star as a modern office worker flung into the past to be Quixote's steadfast servant; Mr. Depp's punk delicacy would make him a dead-solid perfect choice to play a man mistaken for Sancho Panza. And for the Man of La Mancha, Mr. Gilliam recruited the French comic actor Jean Rochefort. In his 70's, this actor has the bent-branch dignity of Cervantes's creation. But like his fictional counterpart, his age would prove to be part of the problem. ''Lost'' burns across the screen like a fever dream, the bad luck coming hard and fast. Some nonfiction films enchant us with the cool, sure hand of filmmaking; that's not the case here. Most great documentaries are about willfulness, either the filmmakers' or the subject's. In ''Lost,'' it's the latter, and the drama comes from our awareness that despite the proud determination of Mr. Gilliam, in the end his efforts will be utterly and completely meaningless. ''Don Quixote'' is a project that has hobbled other talents. Peter O'Toole, ostensibly in more pain than he endured as Lawrence of Arabia, suffered starring in a 1972 screen adaptation of the musical ''Man of La Mancha.'' And Orson Welles, probably Mr. Gilliam's nightmare realization of himself as a luckless maverick, tilted vainly at filming ''Quixote,'' and is referred to here. Mr. Gilliam's ''Quixote,'' for which he pulled together more than $30 million of European financing, suffered every misfortune a director could imagine, like losing days when a usually arid location was hit by monsoon rains. And then his opus was struck by disasters he could never have imagined. The entertainment -- yes, that is a terrible but unfortunately apt word -- comes with watching Mr. Gilliam duck Fate's right hook, only to have it strike back with a catastrophic body blow that catches him unaware. Some of the destruction seems self-inflicted: Mr. Rochefort's accented English does such a linguistic tango that part of Mr. Gilliam's blinking seems to come from trying to comprehend what his Quixote is saying. It's hard to fight the impulse to give all the awful missteps away in unrelenting detail, but ''Lost'' demands to be seen fresh. One welcome surprise that I can reveal is that the film captures Mr. Gilliam's dented but intact confidence, a quality that comes from having survived battles with overbearing studio executives. (His dystrophic, paranoid comedy ''Brazil'' and the battles it provoked are detailed on a lovingly assembled DVD from Criterion.) He also fought forces beyond his control on ''The Adventures of Baron Munchausen.'' This is, after all, a man who had his reputation ruined by ''Munchausen'' -- he was accused of profligate spending when the ambitious film was underbudgeted -- and who bounced back with ''The Fisher King'' and ''12 Monkeys.'' J. K. Rowling acknowledged that Mr. Gilliam's powerfully imaginative ''Time Bandits'' inspired her Harry Potter books. We are able to see the tiny amount of film that was actually shot, and some ingenious tests that Mr. Gilliam made. (The only regret is that ''Lost'' was made with digital video cameras, so we don't get the head-blasting, wide-screen image he filmed.) Finally, after watching the spectacular ''Lost in La Mancha,'' you may wish you'd had your jaw wired shut, since having it drop wide open so often could exhaust you. Mr. Gilliam is such a bizarre, magnetic and ultimately sympathetic figure that you'll find yourself wishing for a happy ending. An end title says he's still looking for financing to resuscitate his ''Don Quixote.'' If he were smart, he'd start putting together money to make a fictional film of ''Lost in La Mancha.'' I'd bet Ian McKellen would make himself available to play the director. ''Lost in La Mancha'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for bouts of angry profanity directed toward an unheeding Fate.

"Mascara as Black as a Jolly Roger","The action comedy ''Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl'' raises one of the most overlooked and important cinematic questions of our time: Can a movie maintain the dramatic integrity of a theme park ride? In this case the answer is -- sure. The director Gore Verbinski's penchant for logistics -- combined with the producer Jerry Bruckheimer's desire to spend like a drunken pirate when it comes to putting everything on screen -- melts into an often frenetic, colorful and entertaining comic adventure that often seems to be using ''Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'' as a template. The dazzling, high-flying silliness is quite an achievement. The movie is better than it deserves to be, given its origins: a ride at Disneyland and Disney World. Mr. Verbinski's staging is as vertiginous as an amusement park ride and places the wiry and beauteous tomboy Keira Knightley at the center. Her physical assurance suggests what Nicole Kidman might be like if she didn't spend so much time coughing tragically into handkerchiefs in an equally tragic pursuit of important roles. Ms. Knightley is Elizabeth Swann, owner of a medallion that gets the plot going a scant hour into ''Pirates.'' This trinket is first seen in a prologue sequence, in which little Elizabeth steals it from an equally young Will Turner. She has also stolen (sigh) his heart, as Will (Orlando Bloom) grows up to be a stalwart blacksmith -- and more than able swordsman -- who nurtures a secret crush on her. Ms. Knightley is strident and confident in her movement, an ability that makes her all the sexier and alluring, which is fortunate, given that her acting skills aren't quite as devastating as her looks. The movie belongs to Johnny Depp as Capt. Jack Sparrow the pirate, a rapscallion who's as woozy as someone who has endured much too much time on a roller coaster. Mr. Depp doesn't get the opportunity to display his gift for comedy often, and his mellow, dizzied underplaying here is a balm, an antidote to the raucous battles and swashbuckling. Gargling his consonants before spitting them out, Mr. Depp's pirate suggests a man who has spent either a great deal of time with Keith Richards after a tour of the Rebel Yell factory, or a man who has spent a great deal of time watching Mike Myers do his Keith Richards impression. Either way, festooned with dreadlocks and braids in his hair and beard, and wearing enough industrial-strength mascara to indicate that Captain Jack was probably influenced by another King of the Wild Frontier -- Adam Ant -- Mr. Depp offers a ratty, bedeviled turn that keeps the picture in motion during that extended period when there's not much plot involved. But when this protracted state of narrative lassitude suddenly shifts, ''Pirates'' brings in enough story line for several movies. And in the words of Bart Simpson, it takes a knife-wielding maniac to show us the way: in this case it's the entrance of the pirate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush, who's nearly as game -- and gamy -- as Mr. Depp). He kidnaps Elizabeth because of the medallion. (There's a side benefit. ''She's the governor's daughter,'' one of Barbossa's hearties cackles.) The medallion turns out to be an enchanted piece of gold, which, with the blood of a special someone, can free Barbossa and his swabbies from their curse: they're the larcenous undead whose skeletons can be seen in the moonlight at night. In addition Barbossa now commands the swift, capable ship the Black Pearl, which he seized from Jack Sparrow in a mutiny, after which he left Sparrow to die. Seeking revenge, Sparrow steals a ship and finds a new crew of his own, including Will, to pursue Barbossa. There are plenty of salty, fatty moments in ''Pirates'' among the clearly staged fighting and rum-flavored comedy provided by Mr. Depp, Mr. Rush and the rest of the cast, including Jonathan Pryce as Elizabeth's craven, officious governor father. It's a hip slice of summer ham. Mr. Verbinski swings his stylistic flourishes, which compel him to turn most interiors into haunted houses for their joke potential, and this notion gives the movie a deliriously antic air. Hilariously, every time the Black Pearl sails into view, an ominous cloud swirls around it, even in beautiful daylight. It's as if Barbossa carries his menacing mystique with him wherever he goes. This is one of the few films that could justify use of a term that should never be used in describing a movie -- a thrill ride -- since it is, after all, based on one. Mr. Verbinski especially uses the scene in which Elizabeth discovers exactly what her captors want, in which she's thrown and shoved as if she were being slammed around on a roller coaster, to remind us of this. There are also several other instances lifted right off the Pirates of the Caribbean ride. The thorough shamelessness of ''Pirates'' -- a trait it shares with many pictures this summer -- becomes part of the motif. And the good-natured professionalism of the cast -- with the exception of Mr. Bloom, who's stranded by the one-note intensity of his role -- adds to the cheerfulness. This broad, fluky comedy hits the groove of a remixed 12-inch single. Eventually it crams in so much plot information that there's an unwieldy surfeit of narrative treasure: it's bootylicious. Perhaps this film's success will bring us a ''Batman, the Ride: The Movie'' or a ''Superman, the Ride: The Movie.'' After ''Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl,'' you will believe a man can synergize. But in these days of much concern about movies being stolen for sale in other forms -- bags were checked for video cameras before ''Pirates'' started -- another philosophical question comes to mind: If you don't like this film, does that make you anti-piracy? ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' is rated PG-13 for strong language, bad taste jokes, gamy supernatural humor and violence.

"Murder Most Musical","Tim Burton makes fantasy movies. Stephen Sondheim writes musicals. It is hard to think of two more optimistic genres of popular art, or of two popular artists who have so systematically subverted that optimism. Mr. Sondheim has always gravitated toward the dissonance lurking in hummable tunes, and has threaded his song-and-dance spectaculars with subtexts of anxiety and alienation. Mr. Burton, for his part, dwells most naturally (if somewhat uneasily) in the realms of the gothic and the grotesque, turning comic books and children’s tales into scary, nightmarish shadow plays. And so it should not be surprising that “Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,” Mr. Burton’s film adaptation of Mr. Sondheim’s musical, is as dark and terrifying as any motion picture in recent memory, not excluding the bloody installments in the “Saw” franchise. Indeed, “Sweeney” is as much a horror film as a musical: It is cruel in its effects and radical in its misanthropy, expressing a breathtakingly, rigorously pessimistic view of human nature. It is also something close to a masterpiece, a work of extreme <U+0097> I am tempted to say evil <U+0097> genius. As it was originally performed onstage, with all the songs Mr. Sondheim composed for it, “Sweeney Todd” balanced its inherent grisliness with a whimsical vitality. The basic story is a revenger’s tragedy more Jacobean than Victorian, but Mr. Sondheim nonetheless wrings some grim, boisterous comedy out of both the impulse for vengeance and the bustling spirit of commerce. A barber, wronged by a powerful judge, returns to London and sets up shop, cutting throats as well as hair. The bodies of his victims are turned into savory meat pies by Mrs. Lovett, his energetic partner in business and crime. Cannibalism and mass murder as the basis for a hit show <U+0097> what a perverse and delicious joke. It seemed a lot less funny in the recent revival, which starred Michael Cerveris and Patti Lupone in roles originated on Broadway by Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury in 1979. Mr. Burton’s film, in spite of the participation of Sacha Baron Cohen (as a mountebank barber in a skin-tight costume) and Timothy Spall (as a louche bailiff) pretty much casts out frivolity altogether. Mr. Burton’s London is a dark, smoky oil slick of a city. Dante Ferretti’s production design, which owes something to the Victorian city confected for Carol Reed’s “Oliver!,” can make even daylight look sinister. Innocence, represented by a pair of young would-be lovers (Jayne Wisener and Jamie Campbell Bower) has virtually no chance in this place; it is a joke played by fate, something to be corrupted, imprisoned or destroyed. Mrs. Lovett the pie maker is played by Helena Bonham Carter, a witchy fixture of Mr. Burton’s cinematic universe as well as the mother of his children. If the director has an alter ego, or at least an actor consistently able to embody his ideas on screen, it would have to be Johnny Depp. He was the hurt, misunderstood man-child in “Edward Scissorhands,” the cracked visionary in “Ed Wood” and the cold, creepy candy mogul in “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,” in each case giving form to an emotional equation that had never quite been seen on film before. As Sweeney, his hair streaked with white and his eyes rimmed in black, he is an avatar of rage. Mr. Depp’s singing voice is harsh and thin, but amazingly forceful. He brings the unpolished urgency of rock ’n’ roll to an idiom accustomed to more refinement, and in doing so awakens the violence of Mr. Sondheim’s lyrics and melodies. Some of the crowd-pleasing numbers, like “The Ballad of Sweeney Todd,” have been pared away, but their absence only contributes to the diabolical coherence of the film, which moves with a furious momentum toward its sanguinary conclusion. Like nearly every other horror-film serial killer <U+0097> the outcast teenager abused by the cool kids; the decent man whose suffering has been ignored or mocked <U+0097> Sweeney starts out as a sympathetic figure. Once upon a time, he was a happy husband and father, until his lovely wife (Laura Michelle Kelly) caught the eye of a malignant judge (Alan Rickman), who transported the poor barber to Australia. Now, after many years, he has returned to find that his daughter, now a teenager, has become the judge’s ward. Finding his old straight razors <U+0097> “my friends” <U+0097> under the floorboards of his former shop, Sweeney sets out to ensnare the judge, a project that requires the deaths of quite a few customers along the way. “They’ll never be missed,” sings the practical Mrs. Lovett. Sweeney’s view is harsher, almost genocidal. “They all deserve to die,” he says, looking out over the rooftops of the city. And Mr. Burton depicts those deaths ruthlessly. The initial geyser of blood may seem artificially bright, but when the bodies slide head first from the chair down a chute into the cellar, they crash and crumple with sickening literalness. You are watching human beings turned into meat. It may seem strange that I am praising a work of such unremitting savagery. I confess that I’m a little startled myself, but it’s been a long time since a movie gave me nightmares. And the unsettling power of “Sweeney Todd” comes above all from its bracing refusal of any sentimental consolation, from Mr. Burton’s willingness to push the most dreadful implications of the story to their blackest conclusions. “Sweeney Todd” is a fable about a world from which the possibility of justice has vanished, replaced on one hand by vain and arbitrary power, on the other by a righteous fury that quickly spirals into madness. There may be a suggestion of hopefulness near the end, but you don’t see hope on the screen. What you see is as dark as the grave. What you hear <U+0097> some of the finest stage music of the past 40 years <U+0097> is equally infernal, except that you might just as well call it heavenly. “Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It’s not “Hairspray.” SWEENEY TODD The Demon Barber of Fleet Street Opens on Friday in New York and Los Angeles.

"Ninth Gate, the (Movie)  ","For those with an interest in seeing a dinner-theater version of ''Eyes Wide Shut,'' then look no further. Roman Polanski's ''Ninth Gate,'' with its wizened decadence -- Darius Khondji's velveteen cinematography looks as if it came out of Rembrandt's Fotomat -- and its tired stabs at comedy, is calling your name. Frank Langella, wearing a hairpiece that is most assuredly from the Stygian depths of Hell, is Boris Balkan, a wealthy and therefore evil collector of Devil-inspired antiquities who hires Dean Corso (Johnny Depp), a weedy rogue book dealer, to locate a volume called ''The Nine Gates.'' You can tell that Corso is a rebel kind of book dealer: he smokes as he pores over vintage tomes and he doesn't wear gloves to keep his skin oils from the delicate pages. Balkan hires Corso to find the volume that will unlock the Nine Gates. The book is so pernicious that it drives an elderly man to hang himself from a noose that doesn't look capable of supporting a pair of socks. Equipped with debonair slashes of white across the sides of his head, Corso begins a search that will take him over several continents and at least 90 minutes because there are three versions of the book in question. He must ascertain which ''Gates'' is authentic and stay a step ahead of Liana (Lena Olin), who cuts a striking figure in black; she was born to be a widow. It was her husband who killed himself, driven mad by some intoxicating combination of her fatale figure and having such a horrific tome in his possession. Aided by his aerodynamic hair detailing, Corso goes from one ''Gates'' owner to another to check out their copies. He's pursued by a sylph (Emmanuelle Seigner) with the vacant stare and bored pout of a 14-year-old idly channel-surfing in hopes of finding MTV's Carson Daly. She races across Europe after Corso. Is she on Corso's side? Will Balkan get Satan's powers in his clutches through mastery of ''The Nine Gates''? And what about Satan? Since the rich in these Devil-quest spectaculars are always searching for the Devil but often come to a bad end, does this mean he's a socialist? Or perhaps, since money attracts money, that he's a supply-sider? These are questions to be answered sooner or later in an issue of Cahiers du Cinema. Or The Industry Standard. In adapting the European slight-fright best seller ''El Club Dumas,'' Mr. Polanski is out to cross ''Rosemary's Baby'' with his saucy spoof ''The Fearless Vampire Killers,'' but this movie is about as scary as a sock-puppet re-enactment of ''The Blair Witch Project,'' and not nearly as funny. There's no leading man less interested in staying close to type than Mr. Depp. His Dean Corso is a craven hustler who makes the detached, cowardly Ichabod Crane he portrayed in ''Sleepy Hollow'' seem as forceful as Buffy the Vampire Slayer; he shows no interest in vesting learned characters with courage. Mr. Polanski's reflexes are gone, so all he can do is watch the camera pass gracefully from set to set. ''The Ninth Gate'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes a lovemaking scene more appropriate for late-night cable viewing, violence, sadism and adult language. THE NINTH GATE Produced and directed by Roman Polanski; written by Enrique Urbizu, Mr. Polanski and John Brownjohn, based on the novel ''El Club Dumas'' by Arturo Perez-Reverte; director of photography, Darius Khondji; edited by Herve de Luze; music by Wojciech Kilar; production designer, Dean Tavoularis; released by Artisan Entertainment.

"Sleepy Hollow (Movie)","The year is 1799 and ''the millennium is almost upon us,'' according to the newly dashing Ichabod Crane played by Johnny Depp in Tim Burton's enthusiastically bleak new movie. And speaking of dashing, when Ichabod gallops north from New York City, he rides up the west bank of the Hudson River although the village of Sleepy Hollow is on the east. But an ornate visual fantasy of Mr. Burton's can be expected to make its own rules, and ''Sleepy Hollow'' does that with macabre gusto. His idea of a beautiful day may be somebody else's nuclear winter, but Mr. Burton eagerly brings his visions of sugarplums to the screen. So when it comes to appearances, this dark, shivery ''Sleepy Hollow'' manages to be as distinctively Burtonesque as ''Edward Scissorhands'' or ''Batman.'' Offering a serenely unrecognizable take on Washington Irving's story and its famously unlucky schoolteacher, the film brings its huge reserves of creativity to bear upon matters like the severing of heads. Quaint Dutch burghers of the Hudson Valley could have bowled ninepins throughout Rip Van Winkle's sleep-in with the supply of decapitated heads sent flying here, even if Mr. Burton handles such sequences with his own brand of wit. Shot 1: Sword approaches victim. Shot 2: Blood splashes Ichabod's glasses. Shot 3: Head rolls away. Shot 4: Body pitches forward. Pause for laugh. History will recognize the rich imagination and secret tenderness of Mr. Burton's best films. (From a purely technical standpoint, as in the award-ready cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki, this grimly voluptuous ''Sleepy Hollow'' must be one of them.) But it will also raise the question of what we were smoking during this period of infatuation with grisliness on screen. It is not unreasonable to admire Mr. Burton immensely without wanting to peer at the exposed brain stems of his characters, but ''Sleepy Hollow'' leaves no choice. As written by Andrew Kevin Walker, who took off Gwyneth Paltrow's head in ''Seven'' and apparently considered that small potatoes, ''Sleepy Hollow'' turns the tale of the Headless Horseman into the pre-tabloid story of a rampaging serial killer. There are reasons to be troubled by this, and they aren't about squeamishness. Mr. Walker's credits also include ''Fight Club,'' a genuinely daring effort to make sense of the violent impulses of buttoned-down young men, and to plumb those dangers found at the nexus of popular culture and political fanaticism. That, at least, had the hallmarks of something different, and it involved a much lower body count than the one racked up by the Headless Horseman. But ''Sleepy Hollow,'' in the guise of an exotic fable and horror-film homage, offers little such ballast. For all its visual cleverness, it's much more conventionally conceived than Mr. Burton's admirers would expect. Even birds nesting in one of the film's vast, wintry indoor sets found themselves trying to get away, moving into the only blossom-filled backdrop that ''Sleepy Hollow'' uses (for brief fantasy scenes). But the bulk of the film unfolds in a forbidding, fairy-tale village and forest that are as ambitious as the Gotham City of ''Batman.'' It is here that Ichabod, who now has a faintly English accent and Mr. Depp's playful charisma, is sent to solve a series of murders and to find that everyone in Sleepy Hollow looks mildly suspect. It is also here that he learns of the vengeful headless Hessian (Christopher Walken in redundant fright makeup) who is the town's main tourist attraction. Using a color palette more often associated with stories of the gulag, ''Sleepy Hollow'' creates a landscape so daunting that even a large tree bleeds. At moments like the one revealing the tree's bloody secret, and in a couple of incidents involving witchcraft, Mr. Burton's film delivers a scare or two, but most of it is too tongue in cheek for that. As this film's Ichabod conducts a Holmesian murder investigation and even unearths a village conspiracy, he has much better luck with Katrina Van Tassel than any traditional Ichabod ever did. Katrina is played photogenically by Christina Ricci, who gets through the film gamely while remaining very much a sardonic creature of her own time. An impressive cast shows off Colleen Atwood's sumptuous costumes and delivers dialogue, some apparently worked on by Tom Stoppard, sometimes graced with a clever edge. Miranda Richardson swishes dangerously through the proceedings as Katrina's obviously wicked stepmother, while the town elders include Michael Gough, Michael Gambon and Jeffrey Jones. The horror patriarch Christopher Lee is here, as well he ought to be. And Marc Pickering plays the teenage sidekick whom Ichabod cautions, as he might the audience, with ''I hope you have a strong stomach.'' Among the many scenes of cheeky mayhem, one finds a little boy cowering beneath floorboards while the Horseman harvests the heads of his parents. In case you were thinking of taking the children. ''Sleepy Hollow'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes fanciful gore and violence, brief sexual situations and a high head count. SLEEPY HOLLOW Directed by Tim Burton; written by Andrew Kevin Walker, based on Washington Irving's tale ''The Legend of Sleepy Hollow''; director of photography, Emmanuel Lubezki; edited by Chris Lebenzon; music by Danny Elfman; costumes by Colleen Atwood; production designer, Rick Heinrichs; produced by Scott Rudin and Adam Schroeder; released by Paramount Pictures.

"Source, The (Movie)  ","''The Source,'' a stirring, kaleidescopic documentary about the Beat generation and its legacy, spans from the exultant 1940's photo of the young friends Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg and William Burroughs to the ''Jeopardy'' show on which contestants could win money by asking, ''Who were the Beats?'' (''Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac and Lawrence Ferlinghetti were part of this group of writers.'') And it moves beyond, to the point of becoming a ghost story. ''It's eternity all the time, so there's no point being nostalgic for eternity,'' Ginsberg (who died in 1997) is heard saying. But that wisdom runs counter to the moving experience of watching this film unfold. The wizardry of Chuck Workman is well known to viewers of the Academy Awards broadcast, which has been dependably brightened by his witty, rapid-fire compilations of film clips. And his acumen remains just as sharp in this feature-length format. Mr. Workman, who also made a feature about Warhol, indeed packs in so many different facets of his subject matter that he would seem to risk glibness; this is, after all, a film in which Bob Hope, Alfred Hitchcock and Fred Flintstone can each be found going the goatee-and-beret route for parody's sake. But ''The Source'' has been made much too knowingly and affectionately to wear thin. Instead, Mr. Workman's comprehensiveness is an obvious virtue. However well known the assorted Beat legends have become, there is a cumulative power to seeing so many of them evoked so colorfully in a single film. And even viewers who know a great deal about Kerouac, for example, may be surprised by his later talk-show appearances, like the one in which he blearily insisted that the Vietnam War was a Vietnamese plot to garner American Jeeps. Or the one in which he is blindsided by William F. Buckley Jr., who is able to pronounce ''yippies'' as if it were a dirty word. The film needn't delve explicitly into the none too hip side of Kerouac revealed in his later years. The pictures seen here do a lot of the storytelling by themselves, especially when images of these rebels at their most young and beautiful are contrasted with scenes of their later years. Dazzling scenes of Neal Cassady dancing bare-chested, with the look of home-movie snippets and an air of utter joy and abandon, speak volumes about why Cassady became legendary even among his own friends. ''He wasn't destined to grow old,'' Mr. Ferlinghetti says of him. ''He was always young and he always will be.'' In addition to offering a magic-bus trip down memory lane, ''The Source'' has serious work to do: capturing the spirit of Beat poetry, watching it evolve from passionate outpourings into a source of caricature and following it through into later cultural manifestations. In tune with the early years, several well-chosen actors bring the writing to life: Johnny Depp intoning Kerouac, John Turturro giving a fiercely emotional reading from Ginsberg's ''Howl'' and Dennis Hopper with the right hat and the right attitude for echoing Burroughs. Perhaps the purest expression of the Beat ethos comes slightly later, from Ken Kesey, who is asked by an incredible interviewer: ''Mr. Kesey, do you feel that you have the right to do what you want, whatever you want and still live in this world?'' Mr. Kesey answers: ''I feel that a man has a right to be as big as he feels it in him to be.'' ''The Source,'' which opens today for a two-week run at the Film Forum and makes for indispensable viewing, later makes connections with hippies, the 60's anti-war movement and a 70's culture with an obvious debt to Beat life-style experimentation. And finally, there is the official recognition: official commemorative ceremonies, Gap ads featuring Beats in khakis and even Kerouac's words emblazoned on a coffee mug. The film could excoriate these manifestations but instead finds them amusing. It has no doubt that the Beats still have true descendants, and that they keep the faith. THE SOURCE Written, produced, directed and edited by Chuck Workman; director of photography, Tom Hurwitz; music by Philip Glass, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, the Doors, Bob Dylan, Stan Getz, Gerry Mulligan, Ornette Coleman, the Rolling Stones, Sonic Youth, Natalie Merchant and David Amram; released by Winstar Cinema.

"BENNY & JOON (MOVIE)","""Benny and Joon"" is a dangerously fanciful story of cute eccentrics, characters whose quirks are the very essence of their appeal. Some of us experience a form of red alert at the very notion of adorable oddballs on screen, but ""Benny and Joon"" turns out to be remarkably benign in that regard. Cheerfully conceived and presented with admirable restraint, it tells of a kindly, long-suffering mechanic named Benny (Aidan Quinn) who struggles to take care of his erratic sister, Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson). Their home life is further complicated midway through the film by the arrival of Sam (Johnny Depp), whose fine-tuned Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin routines keep him as far from contemporary reality as Joon happens to be. Joon winds up with Sam because of a losing bet in a poker game, which makes no less sense than anything else in this breezy, whimsical story. The screenwriter Barry Berman (who wrote the story with Leslie McNeil) has formal training as a circus clown, which explains a lot about Joon's use of props like a snorkel mask and a Ping-Pong paddle, as well as the notion of Sam as some kind of clown savant. Sam is seen happily making grilled-cheese sandwiches on an ironing board and mashing potatoes with a tennis racket, gambits that deeply appeal to Benny and Joon's collective sense of the absurd. ""Did you have to go to school for that?"" one of them asks him. ""No, I got thrown out of school for that,"" Sam replies. Joon, who loves to paint but also likes to set fires, has initially seemed smart, unpredictable and scarily intense. She's capable of placing an emergency call to her brother's repair shop to report a food shortage, and the messages are often as alarming as she means them to be. (""Joon called. She said that you've run out of tapioca. Oh, and the police will corroborate."") She's also capable of breaking a lamp or dropping a burning tissue on the floor for no particular reason, which makes Benny's life with her a constant trial. The story finds them at the point of realizing that each must somehow separate from the other and go it alone. Benny's garage attracts a remarkably high percentage of attractive female customers, whom he tries hard to ignore. But eventually he finds one (Julianne Moore) to help him overcome his shyness. Meanwhile, Joon and Sam discover to their gradual delight that they see the world in much the same way. They become close enough to engage in passionate discussions of common interests, like the suspicious fate of raisins. (""Oh, they taste sweet, but they're really just humiliated grapes,"" Joon says.) But since Sam is functionally illiterate, not even able to fill out a job application in a video store that rents his beloved Chaplin and Keaton films, the possibility of either his or Joon's being able to survive independently remains dim. In a more realistic film (and to some degree this film recalls ""Dominick and Eugene,"" which also dealt with a hard-working brother taking care of a mentally impaired sibling), troubling issues might well shade the story. But ""Benny and Joon"" succeeds in remaining blithe and sunny, directed by Jeremiah Chechik (""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"") with a commercial liveliness and a suitable sense of the absurd. The film's greatest asset is the obvious conviction of its actors, who never condescend to their roles. Mr. Depp may look nothing like Buster Keaton, but there are times when he genuinely seems to become the Great Stone Face, bringing Keaton's mannerisms sweetly and magically to life. As Mr. Depp and the rest of the film makers surely must have known, an impersonation like that is an all-or-nothing proposition. Ms. Masterson, a remarkably incisive and determined actress, never sentimentalizes Joon despite many ripe opportunities to do exactly that. She remains fierce, funny and persuasive even when the film conveniently soft-pedals the reality of Joon's situation. Mr. Quinn, often in the position of playing straight man to the other two leads, still makes Benny a touchingly sincere and sympathetic figure. Also in the cast are Oliver Platt as Benny's wistful, patient partner and Dan Hedaya and Joe Grifasi as longtime participants in the poker game where Sam's services as a roommate are bet. That night, the other ante includes a salad shooter and 150 feet of coaxial cable. ""Benny and Joon"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes mild profanity and discreet sexual situations.

"CRY BABY (MOVIE)","Not content to watch old Presley movies on television, John Waters has made a brand new one, and made it in the manner of a teen-crazed Cecil B. DeMille. ''Cry-Baby,'' Mr. Waters's epic vision of mid-1950's high-school Americana, has a sweeping scale not usually associated with so dopey a subject, and for a while, almost enough exuberance to make that scale seem right. It also has droll costumes, elaborate musical numbers and a cast that's less a dramatic ensemble than a collection of found art. What it doesn't have, unfortunately, is enough true conviction to rise above novelty status. Nor does it really have a plot. Mr. Waters shares with others like David Lynch a profoundly ironic view of picket-fence, middle-American platitudes. But in his case, that manifests itself as a deep and enduring affection for the grotesque, an affection that renders the forced innocence of ''Cry-Baby'' very precarious indeed. Unlike his sunnier and more spontaneous ''Hairspray,'' ''Cry-Baby'' has its brittle side, especially after the fun of initially encountering its ringer-filled cast (e.g. Patricia Hearst as a crossing guard) has worn thin. The latter part of the film is devoted almost entirely to empty posturing. ''Cry-Baby'' casts the television heartthrob Johnny Depp as the bad boy of the title. (''What a sad and silly name for a young man!'' exclaims the judge who finally throws Cry-Baby in the slammer, so that the film can devote a musical segment to jailhouse rock.) It surrounds him with a large and lively supporting cast illustrative of the cultural polarities of its time, from the bad (Traci Lords, highly effective as a hissing, sneering sexpot named Wanda) to the boringly good (sweet-faced Amy Locane, perfectly cast as a nice girl named Allison who's just dying to turn naughty). There is never any question as to where Mr. Waters's own sentiments lie. Sure, he likes a good bunny hop or a dizzyingly silly rendition of ''Mr. Sandman,'' but the real enjoyment here comes from watching the story's overly well-bred characters learn to recognize the error of their ways. Mr. Waters's screenplay has particularly heartfelt fun with lines like ''You sure are pretty in them tight clothes, all dressed up like trash!'' Also tucked into the film, in a peripheral capacity, are such scary specimens as Iggy Pop, Joey Heatherton, Troy Donahue and Joe Dallesandro, cast as the strait-laced parents of this younger generation. It's worth pointing out that David Nelson, seen briefly as Wanda's father (Ms. Hearst plays her mother), looks a lot older than his parents Ozzie and Harriet did at the height of the very era ''Cry-Baby'' celebrates. Three and a half intervening decades mean a lot of distance, and the film too often lets its own ebullience become overshadowed by a detachment that is pointlessly arch. ''Cry-Baby'' is best when unabashedly magnifying vintage trivia into crazily overblown little triumphs, when making bona fide mountains out of molehills. So Mr. Waters ekes a ghoulishly effective opening sequence out of polio vaccination day. (This, of course, is just about the only time the film's hot-blooded delinquents show up at school.) He gets another memorable image out of teen-age couples necking on blankets across an expanse of lawn, with so many of them gathered there that the shot almost looks like science fiction of the pod-person era. ''Cry-Baby'' also concocts settings like the Turkey Point Swim Club, with an exaggeratedly bucolic swimming-hole ambiance, and the RSVP Charm School, repository of those good manners that the film's favorite characters are out to destroy. David Insley's cinematography gives these scenes an uncannily apt color palette, as if the footage had been shot in mid-1950's primaries and then been allowed to fade. There are even times when authentic outdoor scenes become eerily suggestive of studio process shots, simply because so much other artifice has been built in. Mr. Depp, who smolders naturally when he isn't trying so hard, acts this role about as well as Elvis would have; under the circumstances, that's fine. He also changes pace to deliver the occasional satirical aside. Cry-Baby's father, he explains, was ''the Alphabet Bomber,'' electrocuted for blowing up an airport, a barber shop, a car wash and so on. His mother ''couldn't even spell, for chrissake, but they fried her, too.'' The other players in ''Cry-Baby'' embody various degrees of freakishness, some of it way off the charts. Kim McGuire, as the hideously contorted floozy called Hatchet-Face, is too frightening to be funny, and the same can be said for Susan Tyrrell as Cry-Baby's trampy grandma. Closer to the middle of the spectrum is the sporting Ricki Lake, Mr. Waters's plump ''Hairspray'' star, who is here supposed to be pregnant. The straight-arrow section of the cast comprises nerd types of several varieties, from Polly Bergen as the obligatory hoodlum-hating society matron to Stephen Mailer as Allison's overly optimistic beau. Willem Dafoe puts in a brief appearance as a prison guard with some nice things to say about Roy Cohn. Kim Webb plays the nymphomaniac who chases Cry-Baby tirelessly, only to be told, ''He likes his women bad, Lenora - not cheap.'' The world of difference encompassed by that statement is the one ''Cry-Baby'' tries so vigorously to explore. ''Cry-Baby'' is rated PG-13 (''Special Parental Guidance Suggested for Those Younger Than 13''). It includes profanity, and suggestiveness of many different kinds. THE FREAKY 50'S CRY-BABY, written and directed by John Waters; director of photography, David Insley; edited by Janice Hampton; music by Patrick Williams; production designer, Vincent Peranio; produced by Rachel Talalay; released by Universal Pictures.

"EDWARD SCISSORHANDS (MOVIE)","AT the far end of a suburban enclave, where the houses huddle together like a candy-colored wagon train, there stands a monument to lonely genius. Atop a forbidding gray mountain, in yet another of the strange and ingenious outposts that the heroes of Tim Burton's films (""Batman,"" ""Beetlejuice,"" ""Pee-wee's Big Adventure"") call home, Edward Scissorhands lives in isolation. He uses his extraordinary gifts to create magical artworks that, he imagines, no one will ever see. Edward has apparently hidden here for a long time, with nary a trip to the grocery store. But one day, as seems perfectly reasonable in the ripe, fanciful pop universe in which ""Edward Scissorhands"" unfolds, a thoughtful Avon lady (Dianne Wiest) pays a visit. Seeing Edward, she immediately grasps that he has a problem and sweetly imagines that it can be solved with kindness, not to mention the makeup base of exactly the right hue. So the Avon lady brings the outcast back to her home, where he amazes the neighbors with his rare feats of snippery. He's a wizard when it comes to poodles. In a sense, Mr. Burton is too. His ""Edward Scissorhands"" is as crazily single-minded as a majestic feat of dog barbering, with much the same boldness, camp ebullience and fundamentally narrow wit. Like a great chef concocting an exquisite peanut butter-and-jelly sandwich, Mr. Burton invests awe-inspiring ingenuity into the process of reinventing something very small. In the case of ""Edward Scissorhands,"" which opens today at the Ziegfeld, that something is a tale of misunderstood gentleness and stifled creativity, of civilization's power to corrupt innocence, of a heedless beauty and a kindhearted beast. The film, if scratched with something much less sharp than Edward's fingers, reveals proudly adolescent lessons for us all. On, then, to the better side of ""Edward Scissorhands"": the tremendous cleverness with which Mr. Burton brings these ideas to life. As embodied by Johnny Depp, Edward himself is a stunning creation, with a blackish cupid's-bow mouth and plaintive expression to offset his fright hairdo, abundant scars and potentially lethal hands. Those hands, which quiver uncontrollably when Edward experiences strong emotion, are the one aspect of the young man that his creator (played by Vincent Price, who was a hero of Mr. Burton's when the director was still a young Disney animator) neglected to complete. The inventor died just before he could equip Edward with human hands, thus leaving him with these scissor-bladed prototypes. They make a great sight gag, if not a great metaphor. As in each of Mr. Burton's films, the production design is the central good idea, perhaps even the sole one. This time, with production design by Bo Welch (""Beetlejuice"") and cinematography by Stefan Czapsky, it involves bright colors in unlikely combinations, for instance, a lavender-suited Avon lady driving a dandelion-yellow car) and fashionably ridiculous late-1950's artifacts placed prominently throughout the characters' bunkerlike homes. On the lawns of these houses, more and more of Edward's singular topiaries -- in the forms of a ballerina, a penguin, a set of bowling pins and so on -- begin to appear. It is very much in keeping with the film's fearless, defiant illogic that these shrubbery sculptures should appear where no shrubs grew before. Similarly, the film makes no bones about depicting Winona Ryder as a white-haired granny in the not noticeably futuristic prologue, and as a high school girl, circa 1960, when most of the action takes place. Ms. Ryder, in the former capacity, promises to explain to a grandchild what the story of Edward Scissorhands has to do with snowfall. It's also in keeping with the film's reasoning that the explanation for this, when finally revealed, isn't nearly as interesting as promised. Ms. Ryder plays Kim Boggs, the daughter of the Avon lady, Peg, and a dryly deadpan patriarch (played by Alan Arkin). As lovely as she is diffident, she makes an enchanting Beauty to Mr. Depp's poignant, bashful Beast. When Edward first arrives in suburbia, he is so flustered that he scares Kim away. (He also inadvertently punches holes in her waterbed.) But he soon becomes part of the household and part of the community, despite insensitive questions -- like ""Do you know about bowling?"" -- from the locals. Soon Edward is so much at home that he is virtually a household convenience, helping Peg snip threads when she sews. He also becomes extremely popular with the women of the neighborhood, some of them fascinated by his knack for inventing odd haircuts, and one (played with funny flamboyance by Kathy Baker) especially interested in discovering his other talents. The women in the film, with the exceptions of Peg and Kim, are ninnies, but the men are no more flatteringly presented. Kim's boyfriend (Anthony Michael Hall) is a lout, a bully and the cause of Edward's eventual undoing. Among the film's more haunting visual touches, all of which linger much longer than the possible reasons for their inclusion, are the peculiar shrinelike assemblage of clippings in Edward's fireplace; the bladelike beams that open a hole in his roof to the heavens and the inventor's cherished machinery, so pleasantly antiquated that the machines seem to have animal faces. The traces of warmth that spring up unexpectedly, even in the sequence that finds Edward and Kim amid snow and ice, are what save ""Edward Scissorhands"" from its own potential archness and give it the sweetness of a bona-fide fairy tale. ""Edward Scissorhands"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes sexual suggestiveness and occasional rude language.

"NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, A (MOVIE)","IN ''A Nightmare on Elm Street,'' several teen-agers start sharing the same dream in which a long-dead child murderer attempts to carry on his mission from the far side of the grave. That he succeeds for a while should come as no surprise to anyone who keeps up with horror films, especially those in which the mortality rate among sexually active teen-agers is always alarmingly high. John Saxon and Ronee Blakley play - with suitable, furrow-browed seriousness - the parents of the young woman the monster would most love to kill. Her name is Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) and she's pretty and bouncy enough to be a terrific cheerleader. The monster is played by Robert Englund, but what he looks like is anybody's guess, since he wears a lot of masks that are about as scary as those worn by extremely small trick- or-treaters on Halloween. The film was written and directed by Wes Craven, whose earlier films, ''The Last House on the Left'' and ''The Hills Have Eyes,'' specialized in graphically depicted mayhem and gore. ''A Nightmare on Elm Street,'' which opens today at the National and other theaters, puts more emphasis on bizarre special effects, which aren't at all bad.

"WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE (MOVIE)","It's hard to describe the many eccentricities of ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" without making the film sound as if it had a case of terminal whimsy. Better to say that this is the work of Lasse Hallstrom, the Swedish director of ""My Life as a Dog,"" whose gentle, rueful style can accommodate vast amounts of quirkiness in enchanting ways. Mr. Hallstrom is also adept at viewing the world from the perspective of troubled young characters. And Gilbert Grape, the hero and narrator of this story, has troubles to spare. Gilbert lives in Endora, Iowa, a town so flat and featureless that all of its energy seems to have turned inward, particularly where the Grape family is concerned. The Grape household is dominated by 500-pound Momma (Darlene Cates), who hasn't ventured outside in so long that local children sneak up to the Grape windows to stare at her. Gilbert helps them. The household, which also includes two quarrelsome sisters, is kept in a constant state of emergency by Arnie (Leonardo DiCaprio), Gilbert's retarded younger brother. Arnie enjoys heights, and he has a way of climbing to the top of the local water tower whenever Gilbert forgets to watch him. Gilbert himself has a career as a delivery boy, working in the small, outmoded grocery store where few Endorans shop now that a big, modern supermarket has come to town. (The fact that the supermarket has a tank containing live lobsters has created a considerable stir.) Gilbert has been making very special deliveries to Mrs. Betty Carver (Mary Steenburgen) for a long time. ""Uh, get out,"" Betty says to her two small children when Gilbert comes over. ""Go outside and play right now."" Betty may see some urgency in these meetings, but Gilbert has begun to grow bored. Everything in Endora bores him a little, until flirty, diffident Becky (Juliette Lewis) comes to town. To the extent that this offbeat, slyly deadpan film has any forward momentum, it has to do with how Becky's arrival raises Endora's energy level a little. It's also about how Arnie and Momma's various problems finally bring Gilbert to the brink of change. ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" is based on a somewhat darker, more acerbic first novel by Peter Hedges, who also wrote the screenplay. Like a lot of first novels, this one is much stronger on texture and character than on plot, and the film has inherited the same problem. But the screen version of ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" also has a lot to recommend it. Particularly impressive are the sweet, weirdly idyllic tone of Mr. Hallstrom's direction and Johnny Depp's tender, disarming performance as the long-suffering Gilbert Grape. In films like ""Edward Scissorhands"" and ""Benny and Joon,"" Mr. Depp has made a specialty of playing gentle outsiders, and doing so with enormous charm. He brings much the same soulfulness and strength to this role, even though for once he is cast as a pillar of the community. This particular community needs every pillar it can find, as does the Grape house itself, which sags badly under the spot where Momma holds court in the living room. Momma so seldom leaves the sofa that her children bring the kitchen table over to her at mealtimes. Mr. Hallstrom, working much more comfortably in an American setting than he did in the 1990 ""Once Around"" (which took place in the Boston area), has done a particularly canny job of casting this film. The impossible role of Momma is ideally played by Ms. Cates, who was spotted on a ""Sally Jessy Raphael"" episode about overweight women who never leave home. Ms. Cates, believable and emphatic, has done herself and the film a big favor by getting out of the house for this. Some of the film's minor characters are also very well etched, particularly the avid young mortician (Crispin Glover) who takes his work a little too seriously and likes to talk about it over lunch. Ms. Lewis is seductively good as someone obviously bemused by what goes on in Endora, and by Gilbert himself. But the film's real show-stopping turn comes from Mr. DiCaprio, who makes Arnie's many tics so startling and vivid that at first he is difficult to watch. Mr. DiCaprio, who also had a prominent role in ""This Boy's Life"" earlier this year, winds up capturing the enormous range of Arnie's raw emotions, and making it clear why the Grape brothers share such an unbreakable bond. The performance has a sharp, desperate intensity from beginning to end. ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" has been given an invitingly bucolic glow by Sven Nykvist's cinematography, which makes the antics of the Grapes that much more colorfully incongruous. The film's hairdresser, apparently thinking like a Grape herself, gives Ms. Lewis a spiky-looking brush cut while letting Mr. Depp fit one of Gilbert's lines from the novel: ""My hair is so long that it's beginning to eat my head."" ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes mild profanity and sexual situations.

"‘Aquaman’ Review: Our Hero Swims. His Movie Sinks.","Nobody’s going to “Aquaman” for the metaphors. And to be fair, nobody put metaphors in “Aquaman.” Yet when a set of plastic six-pack rings drifts past the camera, you do wonder whether it’s a nod to pollution or a wink at Jason Momoa’s fitness. Momoa is why some of us are going to “Aquaman.” He’s in one poster with his smoky eyes peeking out of some water. One hand’s gripping a trident. The other’s going “hang ten.” (He’s half native Hawaiian.) But none of that surf humor and none of that hotness are really anywhere in this movie. It’s just two and a half years — sorry, two and a half hours — of oceanic screen savers and hair that won’t stop undulating so we know when we’re underwater. Aquaman’s been dragged out of DC’s Justice League. His pals include Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman, and his movie is as mediocre as the latest versions of theirs. Maybe “SpongeBob SquarePants” and “The Shape of Water” have set the bar too high for marine absurdity, but your local aquarium has a stronger sense of wonder than “Aquaman.” It does get off to a good, romantic-comedy start, though. Nicole Kidman washes up wounded, more or less, at the Maine lighthouse of Temuera Morrison. He nurses her. She slurps up his goldfish. And Kidman gets closer to Daryl Hannah in “Splash” than you might have thought necessary. Anyway, here she’s Atlanna, the superpowered queen of Atlantis. He’s Tom Curry, a civilian hunk in flannel. Together, they have a kid named Arthur Curry, whose ability to talk to marine life makes him Aquaman. And, after a quick, home-demolishing battle, Atlanna is dragged back to Atlantis, leaving adult Arthur bitterly certain that the Atlantan power structure has killed her for her sexual amphibiousness. What ensues isn’t a search for her or a plot for revenge. It’s a film that seems obligated to be a movie about an Arthur — the wrong one! There’s a nice, beery scene that lets Momoa sulk at a bar with Morrison in a way that calls to mind Dudley Moore’s miserable heir who drank himself silly in “Arthur.” A whole movie of that would have been something. Instead, we get the tired old, other Arthur, a plebe destined for royalty, who, here, is put on a quest to find some long-lost trident that will help prove him King of Atlantis. Because he doesn’t want the job, the movie saddles him with Mera (Amber Heard). She’s some water warrior who doesn’t want to see her home ruled by Arthur’s power-drunk, younger half brother, Orm (Patrick Wilson). So she has to keep shoving Arthur into heroism. Meanwhile — you knew there’d be a meanwhile — we get to know a sexy pirate (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II). He wants Aquaman to pay for letting his pirate father (Michael Beach) die on a doomed ship they were trying to rob. This means lots of time with Pirate Jr. cooking up a way to get back into the main plot. His chance comes courtesy of Orm, who communicates with him via holographic splotch. There is a frisson of delight in seeing a biracial hero dominate a superhero movie and, in Abdul-Mateen, his black foe. But you can’t build a whole blockbuster out of just that. The novelty of Momoa in this part isn’t unexciting. He’s an inspired left-field choice for Aquaman, who in the DC comic books, and the cartoons they inspired, tended to be a slab of Eagle Scout-y blondness. In another age, Paul Walker would have played him. Now he’s this imposingly big, impenetrably chill, multiracial, biker type, sheathed in tribal tattoos, with a long, dark mane. (Now, only the highlights are blond.) That physique is a draw. You could make a taco with the crease in his back, and his pecs almost whisper for a pillow case. This is to say that Momoa might be the last person you’d pick for somebody named Arthur but the first for a movie in need of a star to plow shirtless from one wet location to another. But the people responsible for “Aquaman” seem a little embarrassed to lavish Momoa with even a lick of lust. The camera doesn’t manage to take him all the way in until closing time. And after an introduction in which he fights crime in only a pair of dark jeans, he endures a sequence in the desert (please, don’t make me explain) wearing a long-sleeved Henley and linen slacks. (With all due respect to SpongeBob, those are square pants.) The people who made three “Thor” films never seemed to have this problem. The people who made three “Thor” films also had Chris Hemsworth, an actor eventually allowed to find his hunkiness kind of funny. Momoa, for now, seems stuck. Should he give this part some personality? Should he give an actual performance, as an Adonis or even as an Arthur? Back in 2011, the movies tried to make a star of him in a recycled version of “Conan the Barbarian,” which seemed to believe that all there is to do with fit actors is have them do the routines of fit forebears. Having them play superheroes instead is only slightly more imaginative. Momoa is a better Aquaman than he was a Conan. And yet grumpy, cocky, mumbly Arthur is still an action-star salad — a little bit Willis, a little bit Stallone and the tiniest chip off the old Rock. And the movie, which James Wan (“Saw,” “The Conjuring,” “Furious 7”) directed from a script credited to David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick and Will Beall, doesn’t seem interested in giving him a character with either an inner life or much of a personal one. Momoa is merely required to hit plot points — and people. No wonder he rarely seems excited to be here. There’s nothing to be excited about. “Aquaman” is so much like parts of “Thor” and “Black Panther” and “Avatar” and “The Jewel of the Nile” and so reliant upon an ancient British legend that you don’t know why the people who made this movie bothered. None of Wan’s skills as a builder of suspense sequences come in handy here. He’s minding a circus. When Adbul-Mateen makes his big re-entry, he has to announce his new villain name, but through a giant helmet that makes him look like an electronic music D.J. at the BET Awards. The helmet is so big that when he says, “I am. Black —” I didn’t catch what Black he was. Black Mamba? Black Mumford? Apparently, it’s Black Manta, but I really did have to look that up. Wilson’s silver hair is slicked back so he looks like his father is either Draco Malfoy or Ivan Drago. As it happens, the man who played Ivan Drago is here, too, as the king Kidman fled. But this is the sort of obvious aquatic movie that might have cast Dolph Lundgren because his name is Dolph. Poor Amber Heard has to perform her scenes in a scarlet wig and emerald green costume and do superpower acting with her mouth agape. She looks like she ate 40 Katy Perry songs and is belching them up. There’s even room for a hobbit-y Willem Dafoe, as Arthur’s guide and trainer. And: What are the physics of Atlantis? How do some things float and others lethally — loudly — hurtle to the sea floor? There’s no joy or wonder to behold, just comic-book movie blah-blah. All these larded-on extra characters and this extraneous plot leave you with the sense that nobody trusted Momoa to carry more of this thing on his own. Has nobody seen this man’s shoulders! He does get saddled with romantic silliness and lots of “half-breed” put-downs. And, in its way, the movie treats him accordingly, like he’s 50 percent bouncer and 50 percent something that you’d get with a Happy Meal.","aquaman metaphors fair metaphors aquaman set plastic pack rings drifts past camera nod pollution wink jason momoa fitness momoa aquaman poster smoky eyes peeking water hand gripping trident hang ten half native hawaiian surf humor hotness movie half half hours oceanic screen savers hair won stop undulating underwater aquaman dragged dc justice league pals include superman batman woman movie mediocre versions spongebob squarepants shape water set bar marine absurdity local aquarium stronger sense aquaman romantic comedy start nicole kidman washes wounded maine lighthouse temuera morrison nurses slurps goldfish kidman closer daryl hannah splash atlanna superpowered queen atlantis tom curry civilian hunk flannel kid named arthur curry ability talk marine life makes aquaman quick home demolishing battle atlanna dragged atlantis leaving adult arthur bitterly atlantan power structure killed sexual amphibiousness ensues isn search plot revenge film obligated movie arthur wrong nice beery scene momoa sulk bar morrison calls mind dudley moore miserable heir drank silly arthur movie tired arthur plebe destined royalty quest lost trident prove king atlantis doesn job movie saddles mera amber heard water warrior doesn home ruled arthur power drunk half brother orm patrick wilson shoving arthur heroism sexy pirate yahya abdul mateen ii aquaman pay letting pirate father michael beach die doomed ship rob means lots time pirate jr cooking main plot chance courtesy orm communicates holographic splotch frisson delight biracial hero dominate superhero movie abdul mateen black foe build blockbuster novelty momoa isn unexciting inspired left field choice aquaman dc comic books cartoons inspired tended slab eagle scout blondness age paul walker played imposingly impenetrably chill multiracial biker type sheathed tribal tattoos dark mane highlights blond physique draw taco crease pecs whisper pillow momoa person pick named arthur movie star plow shirtless wet location people responsible aquaman embarrassed lavish momoa lick lust camera doesn manage closing time introduction fights crime pair dark jeans endures sequence desert don explain wearing sleeved henley linen slacks due respect spongebob square pants people thor films people thor films chris hemsworth actor eventually allowed hunkiness funny momoa stuck personality actual performance adonis arthur movies star recycled version conan barbarian fit actors routines fit forebears play superheroes slightly imaginative momoa aquaman conan grumpy cocky mumbly arthur action star salad bit willis bit stallone tiniest chip rock movie james wan conjuring furious directed script credited david leslie johnson mcgoldrick beall doesn giving character life personal momoa required hit plot people rarely excited excited aquaman thor black panther avatar jewel nile reliant ancient british legend don people movie bothered wan skills builder suspense sequences handy minding circus adbul mateen makes entry announce villain giant helmet makes electronic music bet awards helmet black didn catch black black mamba black mumford apparently black manta wilson silver hair slicked father draco malfoy ivan drago played ivan drago king kidman fled sort obvious aquatic movie cast dolph lundgren dolph poor amber heard perform scenes scarlet wig emerald green costume superpower acting mouth agape ate katy perry songs belching hobbit willem dafoe arthur guide trainer physics atlantis float lethally loudly hurtle sea floor joy behold comic book movie blah blah larded extra characters extraneous plot leave sense trusted momoa carry shoulders saddled romantic silliness lots half breed movie treats percent bouncer percent happy meal"
"Ah, Those Giddy Teenage Pool Parties","A horror movie rises from the dead with “All the Boys Love Mandy Lane,” a theatrical release seven years in coming. Though it had its premiere at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival, this feature-length debut from Jonathan Levine has a timeless premise: Horny teenagers are picked off by a bloodthirsty killer in an isolated location. The delay is marginally more an injustice than a condemnation. Amber Heard, less prepackaged at around the age of 20, stars as the self-possessed Mandy, who joins some pseudo-friends for a weekend at a ranch house that turns bloody. The hormonal realism to the performances and a laid-back run-up give the film a fairly legitimate feel for adolescence. (Mr. Levine has since directed three more features, including “The Wackness,” about a teenage New York pot dealer whose shrink is Ben Kingsley.) You might forget that people are going to be killed, if it weren’t for a vertiginous prologue involving a pool party and Mandy’s unsettling male pal, who, unlike her, hasn’t garnered respect or lustful looks from his outsider status. There’s a slightly nasty twist to some of the violence, with an air of school shooter menace ultimately creeping in as the group’s tormentor is revealed. Mr. Levine and the cinematographer Darren Genet draw some nice effects from long shots of pursuits and a vaguely 1970s look, which wasn’t cutting-edge during the film’s making but suits the real-time nostalgia of high school activities, even murderous ones. “All the Boys Love Mandy Lane” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for strong, disturbing violence; pervasive drug and alcohol use; sexual situations; and brattily bad language.

"And Soon the Darkness (Movie)","When art goes wrong there is nothing to do but lament the loss. The failure, say, of ""Zabriskie Point"" is a failure in personal vision and it is not subject to correction. But when an entertainment goes wrong, all sorts of ideas spring to mind, for everything is subject to correction.It was therefore in a fever of vicarious creativity that I sat through Robert Fuest's ""And Soon the Darkness,"" which opened yesterday at the Forum and Murray Hill Theaters, and which should have been a good movie.Two British girls alone on a bicycle holiday in France, deserted stretches of country road, a few small towns with roadside cafes, flat reaches of open field interrupted only by an occasional overgrown wood unpleasantly dark in the glaring light of the day—elements that the film puts to purposes of atmosphere and terror with considerable economy—until it loses its purpose and squanders everything it has earned in a mad effort to preserve suspense.Ultimately ""And Soon the Darkness"" tries to keep you guessing by the expedients of disguising good as evil and of providing so many false clues that not even the fruitiest denouement (in fact there is no denouement) would justify them.Everything hinges on the disappearance of one of the girls, the suspicion of sexual assault, the inability of the other girl to make herself understood or to learn what the local people think and fear themselves. Until the disappearance and for a while afterward everything goes very well toward building tension with understated effects. But eventually, by mere repetition, the understated effects begin to look like poverty of the imagination. Then terror becomes a function of gratuitous camera technique, and danger the product of dishonest characterization.The minor characters seem unusually well detailed in ""And Soon the Darkness,"" and because none of them speak English, the details merge into interesting patterns of frustrated hostility. The secondary people who do speak English (Sandor Eles and Clare Kelly) fare less well, at least partly because they must contend with some of the larger idiocies of the plot.I liked both Pamela Franklin and Michele Dotrice as, respectively, the prudent and the imprudent of the two girls. Pretty and a little plump, by no means glamorous, they are, if only for the matter-of-factness of their portrayals, exactly right for their parts. And Miss Franklin, who does the principal work in the film, keeps her mounting fear well the proper side of hysteria.

"On a Mission, but Not From God","There are those who insist that no great work of cinematic art will ever be presented in 3-D. The most persuasive among them — Roger Ebert, for example — offer learned arguments grounded in science and aesthetics. None of that really has anything to do with “Drive Angry,” which at least in its 3-D version makes a loud, incoherent but oddly compelling case for the enhancing effects of stereoscopic projection on certain treasured objects of the cinematic gaze, like classic Detroit muscle cars, women’s breasts and Nicolas Cage. Last things first. Mr. Cage’s acting style — if that is still the right term — seems these days to require not an extra dimension, but rather an entire parallel universe. In this movie, he plays a grandfather from hell (I mean that literally, though to say more might count as a spoiler) with lank blond hair, a haunted demeanor and the poetical name of John Milton, a sop to the English literature grad students who are sure to flock to this movie. The details of his character are both preposterous and beside the point, as “Drive Angry,” directed by Patrick Lussier (“My Bloody Valentine 3D,” “Dracula 2000”), from a script he wrote with Todd Farmer, lets Mr. Cage continue his exploration of the mysteries of the universe. His companion is Amber Heard, playing a hard-luck waitress who can both throw and take a mean punch and whose very short denim shorts compete for attention with the 1969 Dodge Charger she drives. You can guess how she drives it, though there is plenty of anger to go around, and a lot of action, some of it pretty inspired. And also a gooey heap of plot, which is revealed efficiently and without too much concern for plausibility of any kind. Milton is on a mission to rescue a baby from a Satanic cult led by a neorockabilly messiah (Billy Burke) with long fingernails and what may be a prosthetic soul patch. Giving chase is a dapper fellow who identifies himself as “the Accountant” (William Fichtner) and who is invulnerable to everything except the magical antique gun that Milton keeps with his gear. Apart from some half-cartoonish digital effects and the whole 3-D thing, “Drive Angry” could almost be mistaken for a raunchy, cheesy exploitation programmer of the same vintage as some of its cars. Or rather, a whole retrospective of disreputable ’70s B pictures, what with the cars, the supernatural mumbo-jumbo, the churning, anonymous heavy-metal guitars of Michael Wandmacher’s score and the nudity. All of these elements combine in one extraordinary sequence, during which Milton manages to gun down about a dozen Lucifer-loving, farm-implement-wielding thugs, while smoking a cigar and taking slugs from a bottle of whiskey. And, through the whole bloody barrage, having sex. “That never happened to me before,” his partner says later, recalling the episode more graphically and succinctly than I can here. “Has it ever happened to you?” “Drive Angry” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Swearing, sex, Satanism. DRIVE ANGRY Opened on Friday nationwide. Directed by Patrick Lussier; written by Todd Farmer and Patrick Lussier; director of photography, Brian Pearson; edited by Patrick Lussier and Devin C.

"Review: ‘The Adderall Diaries,’ a Sprawl of Unreliable Memories","A father and son duke it out over who is the bigger victim in “The Adderall Diaries,” Pamela Romanowsky’s misbegotten adaptation of the 2009 memoir by Stephen Elliott. Packed with unconvincing pain and unsexy couplings, the (seemingly deliberately) befuddled story dives into the questionable memories of Stephen (James Franco), a spectacularly narcissistic writer. Newly lauded for a tell-all autobiography, Stephen is stunned when the father he claimed was dead (Ed Harris) shows up at a book reading to harangue him for wallowing in a misremembered past. Creatively blocked, Stephen surrenders to masochistic sex and self-pity, aided by pills and a reporter (Amber Heard) for The New York Times, whose journalistic endeavors consist of making out and striking moody poses. Slow-motion flashbacks to huffing teenagers and parental abuse puncture the narrative as Stephen, likening himself to Truman Capote, becomes obsessed with a high-profile murder trial. Yet it’s impossible to get a bead on him; like the script — and even the cinematography — he’s all affect and no personality. Spouting stiltedly clichéd dialogue (“I’m not going to let anything happen to you,” Stephen tells the reporter, who is threatened by nothing and no one), the actors struggle to sell their characters. Only Mr. Harris eventually succeeds, conveying, in a single speech, what it must be like to be the parent of an addict. It’s one of only two moments when you can feel the film try to push beyond its shallow posturing, but the effort is fruitless — as one character realizes, finally turning a water hose on Stephen’s flailing self-absorption. It’s the most satisfying few seconds in the entire movie. “The Adderall Diaries” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Throat throttling, coke snorting and clothespin foreplay.","father son duke bigger victim adderall diaries pamela romanowsky misbegotten adaptation memoir stephen elliott packed unconvincing pain unsexy couplings seemingly deliberately befuddled story dives questionable memories stephen james franco spectacularly narcissistic writer newly lauded autobiography stephen stunned father claimed dead ed harris book reading harangue wallowing misremembered past creatively blocked stephen surrenders masochistic sex pity aided pills reporter amber heard york times journalistic endeavors consist striking moody poses slow motion flashbacks huffing teenagers parental abuse puncture narrative stephen likening truman capote obsessed profile murder trial impossible bead script cinematography affect personality spouting stiltedly clichéd dialogue happen stephen tells reporter threatened actors struggle sell characters harris eventually succeeds conveying single speech parent addict moments feel film push shallow posturing effort fruitless character realizes finally water hose stephen flailing absorption satisfying entire movie adderall diaries rated requires accompanying parent adult guardian throat throttling coke snorting clothespin foreplay"
"Review: In ‘London Fields,’ Sex, Apocalypse and Writer’s Block","“London Fields,” directed by Matthew Cullen and adapted from Martin Amis’s 1989 novel, is, quite simply, horrendous — a trashy, tortured misfire from beginning to end. In limbo for years because of a number of legal disputes, this laboriously bizarre picture is narrated by Samson Young (Billy Bob Thornton, drained and dispirited), a dying, creatively stalled American writer who has swapped apartments with a celebrated British author (Jason Isaacs). “There was no book without the girl,” Samson intones as his mysteriously mourning muse, Nicola Six (Amber Heard), appears in black veil and a cloud of pheromones. The year is 1999 and some kind of worldwide catastrophe is unfolding, but Nicola’s main problems seem to be a lack of outerwear and the ability to foresee her own murder. Whether her lover-cum-killer will be the besotted banker (Theo James), the cretinous criminal (an odiously mouth-breathing Jim Sturgess), or Samson himself is a riddle we could not possibly be less interested in solving. The arrival of Johnny Depp as a ludicrously dressed gangster with an entourage of weirdos does nothing to reverse that position. (It does, however, signal that the movie’s costume designer was having much more fun than any of its stars.) Failing to even glancingly approximate the book’s trippy energy or linguistic dazzle, Cullen ricochets between Heard’s slow-motion, perfume-ad close-ups and lurid, comic-book noir. The result is alienating and bogus, as senseless as the image of Nicola’s floating, diaphanous panties. “I’m pretty worried that the critics are going to call you a male fantasy figure,” Samson frets. Done.","london fields directed matthew cullen adapted martin amis simply horrendous trashy tortured misfire beginning limbo legal disputes laboriously bizarre picture narrated samson billy bob thornton drained dispirited dying creatively stalled american writer swapped apartments celebrated british author jason isaacs book girl samson intones mysteriously mourning muse nicola amber heard appears black veil cloud pheromones worldwide catastrophe unfolding nicola main lack outerwear ability foresee murder lover cum killer besotted banker theo james cretinous criminal odiously mouth breathing jim sturgess samson riddle possibly solving arrival johnny depp ludicrously dressed gangster entourage weirdos reverse position signal movie costume designer fun stars failing glancingly approximate book trippy energy linguistic dazzle cullen ricochets heard slow motion perfume ad close ups lurid comic book noir result alienating bogus senseless image nicola floating diaphanous panties pretty worried critics call male fantasy figure samson frets"
"Review: In ‘One More Time,’ a Dysfunctional Family Sings","How many more times will we have to watch a movie about a dysfunctional, overprivileged family whose self-absorbed members are the cause of their own problems? Apparently at least “One More Time,” which is the title of a new film by Robert Edwards that plows this tedious ground yet again. Mr. Edwards, also the screenwriter, at least has a somewhat novel plot variation and a big-name cast to tell his small story. Christopher Walken plays Paul Lombard, a faded crooner in the Frank Sinatra mold, who dreams of a comeback. Amber Heard is Jude, one of his daughters, who has a little musical talent but none of the ambition needed to capitalize on it. As the movie opens, she has lost her Brooklyn apartment and is moving back in with Dad in the Hamptons. (Yes, we get to hear Mr. Walken and Ms. Heard sing.) Because these family members, like those in every movie of this stripe, hang around together constantly, although they don’t like one another, Jude’s far more successful sister, Corinne (Kelli Garner), is also on hand with her husband, Tim (Hamish Linklater). The usual dynamics are served up, along with the inevitable tense dinners — Jude and Tim once had a thing; Dad prefers Corinne to Jude; and so on. This sort of boilerplate family drama distracts from the film’s only interesting thread, Paul’s comeback attempt, but maybe that’s just as well, since it isn’t all that credible, anyway. The movie banks a lot on the strained relationship between Paul and Jude, who seem not to recognize their similarities: Both are musical; both will sleep with practically any member of the opposite sex, no matter who gets hurt. But it does nothing with the comparison. This is a story full of people being miserable, humorless and selfish, despite having been given a lot in life, and they’re pretty much the same at the end of it as they were at the beginning.","times watch movie dysfunctional overprivileged family absorbed apparently time title film robert edwards plows tedious ground edwards screenwriter plot variation cast story christopher walken plays paul lombard faded crooner frank sinatra mold dreams comeback amber heard jude daughters musical talent ambition capitalize movie lost brooklyn apartment moving dad hamptons hear walken ms heard sing family movie stripe hang constantly don jude successful sister corinne kelli garner hand husband tim hamish linklater usual dynamics served inevitable tense dinners jude tim dad prefers corinne jude sort boilerplate family drama distracts film thread paul comeback attempt isn credible movie banks lot strained relationship paul jude recognize similarities musical sleep practically opposite sex matter hurt comparison story people miserable humorless selfish lot life pretty beginning"
"Young, Cute and Menaced, Per Usual","“John Carpenter’s The Ward,” his first feature since the disappointing “Ghosts of Mars” (2001), continues the painful decline of a director who seems more nostalgic for past glories than excited about new ideas. Quaintly old-fashioned in style, plot and special effects, this familiar tale of female derangement and institutional abuse is too tame to scare and too shallow to engage. Set in a brooding Oregon asylum (played by the Eastern State Hospital near Spokane, Wash.) in the 1960s — presumably to allow the writers, Michael and Shawn Rasmussen, free rein with medieval treatment protocols — the film feels as confined as the asylum’s fetching young inmates. This could be because each of them is allotted exactly one personality trait apiece: the artist (Lyndsy Fonseca), the flirt (Danielle Panabaker), the infant (Laura-Leigh) and the wild card (Mamie Gummer, whose recent appearances as a razor-sharp lawyer on “The Good Wife” reveal a talent far beyond what’s expected of her here). Into this variety pack of nut cases comes Kristen (Amber Heard) — the rebel — a blond amnesiac whose shrink (Jared Harris) would like to know why she set fire to a farmhouse while dressed in her underwear. Kristen, for her part, would like the identity of the ghoul who’s stealing her blanket at night and stalking her in the hospital corridors. Considering that she’s confined to the most underpopulated ward in the history of loony-bin pictures, said identity should not be too difficult to figure out. Before we do, however — in a final, threadbare reveal that’s visible from the cheap seats — Kristen’s companions will encounter the intruder in a series of set pieces as retro as the television programs bleating from the ward’s ancient set. Few audience members under 50 will recognize the snippet of “What’s My Line?,” but almost everyone will be familiar with the creepy medical staff, crashing thunderstorms and body-invasion interludes. Sadly, in a post-“Saw” world, electroshock therapy no longer delivers the jolt it used to. Much of the time the forces behind “The Ward” seem wistful for the 1980s, Mr. Carpenter’s most memorable decade. Back then, whether working with a Stephen King story like “Christine” (1983), the beautifully restrained sci-fi romance “Starman” (1984) or the anti-capitalism classic “They Live” (1988), he poked at our insularity and materialism with B-movie glee. Here, his jumpy camera and occasionally arresting widescreen compositions are pleasing yet devoid of tension or surprise. The problem is not that we can’t unsee “Saw” but that Mr. Carpenter — unlike his genre colleague Sam Raimi — can’t look forward for looking back. “The Ward” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Hotties in straitjackets and pointy objects in eyeballs. JOHN CARPENTER’S THE WARD Opens on Friday in New York and Los Angeles.
