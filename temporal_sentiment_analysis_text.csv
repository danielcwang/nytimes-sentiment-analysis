"#MeToo Cases’ New Legal Battleground: Defamation Lawsuits","Ashley Judd was one of the first women to attach her name to accusations of sexual misconduct against Harvey Weinstein, but like many of the claims that followed, her account of intimidating sexual advances was too old to bring Mr. Weinstein to court over. Then a legal window opened to her. After reading about a director’s claim that Mr. Weinstein’s studio, Miramax, had described Ms. Judd as a “nightmare to work with,” she sued the producer for defamation in 2018. Mr. Weinstein’s rape trial in Manhattan, which began with jury selection last week, is a spectacle not only because he is the avatar of the #MeToo era, but also because it is one of the few sexual assault cases to surface with allegations recent enough to result in criminal charges. So, unable to pursue justice directly, women and men on both sides of #MeToo are embracing the centuries-old tool of defamation lawsuits, opening an alternative legal battleground for accusations of sexual misconduct. While the facts of the cases vary, the plaintiffs are generally using defamation law not just for its usual purpose — to dissuade damaging speech about them — but also as a tool to enlist the courts to endorse their version of disputed events. This year, key verdicts are expected in defamation cases involving President Trump, the Senate candidate Roy Moore and the actor Johnny Depp, and lawyers are watching the proceedings closely. In some cases, women are basing their suits on recent statements in which the men they accused called them liars; or in Ms. Judd’s case, on a disparaging statement she said she was not aware of until the director, Peter Jackson, revealed it in a 2017 interview. Men like Mr. Depp are using defamation suits to fend off allegations from women, in his case, his ex-wife Amber Heard, who accused him of domestic abuse. Courts have only begun to grapple with this #MeToo-inspired wave of defamation lawsuits, which are, in some cases, being brought because the statutes of limitations on sexual misconduct can be as short as one year, depending on the state and severity of the accusation. Those statutes are a bedrock legal concept designed to discourage people from being sued or imprisoned based on witness memories that may have eroded over the years. The cases raise a swirl of issues, including the appropriate limits on freedom of speech; the power of social media, where an accusation can spread on platforms that vary in reliability and authority; and whether the statutes of limitations should be extended, as some states have already done. Advocates on both sides are anxious. Lawyers for people accused of misconduct fear that a string of defamation victories for women will prevent men who believe they have been wrongly accused from freely defending themselves. At the same time, backers of the #MeToo movement fear that a spate of defamation cases against women will push victims back into the shadows. “The next year is going to be very interesting when it comes to the law of defamation,” said Sigrid McCawley, a lawyer representing Virginia Giuffre, who said she was a victim of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking operation and accused Mr. Epstein’s ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell and the lawyer Alan Dershowitz of being part of it. After they issued statements saying she was lying, she sued them for defamation. Mr. Dershowitz has countersued Ms. Giuffre for defamation; Ms. Maxwell settled in 2017. “We’re going to see a wave of opinions that will shape that landscape quite a bit,” Ms. McCawley said. Several cases involve big names in politics and entertainment. Summer Zervos, a former “Apprentice” contestant, filed a defamation lawsuit against Mr. Trump for his comments during his presidential campaign that her accusations of unwanted kissing and groping were fabricated. The president has argued that he cannot be sued in state court while in office, an issue that is likely headed for New York’s highest court. Its decision will be closely watched by E. Jean Carroll, who filed a similar claim against Mr. Trump after he said that she had lied about his raping her to increase sales of her new book. Leigh Corfman, who accused Mr. Moore of touching her sexually when she was 14, sued him for defamation after he called her story false, malicious and “politically motivated.” That trial is expected to start this year in Alabama. Mr. Moore lost his Senate race in 2017 after accusations surfaced from Ms. Corfman and other women. And last year, at least eight women reached settlements with Bill Cosby’s insurance company to end their defamation lawsuits. They filed them after his representatives accused them of lying when they said Mr. Cosby had sexually assaulted them decades ago. At the same time, defamation suits are a go-to strategy for accused men trying to preserve their reputations. Mr. Depp’s lawsuit is expected to go to trial this summer in Virginia unless the judge dismisses it. And a judge in Brooklyn is considering whether to allow or throw out a lawsuit filed by the writer Stephen Elliott against Moira Donegan, the creator of a widely circulated list of men accused of sexual misconduct that included him. Mr. Elliott, 48, who denied having assaulted anyone, said in an interview that after his essay about the accusation was rebuffed by mainstream news outlets and with his career in shambles, he saw a defamation lawsuit as his only option. “What would you do if you had been falsely accused of rape?” he said. There are lower-profile cases moving through the courts, too. Thirty-three out of 193 cases that the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund supports involve defending workers who came forward about sexual harassment and were then sued for defamation, said Sharyn Tejani, the fund’s director. For many plaintiffs, a benefit of suing for defamation is the opportunity to air the facts of what happened years ago, even if they are unable to sue for harassment or assault. “In order to prove you’re a truth teller, you have to prove it happened,” said Joseph Cammarata, who represented seven Cosby accusers. “This is a direct way to get at the person who assaulted you.” In Ms. Judd’s case, it could lead to a hearing over her account of visiting Mr. Weinstein’s room at the Peninsula Beverly Hills hotel one morning in late 1996 or early 1997, expecting a professional breakfast. She said that Mr. Weinstein, wearing a bathrobe, had requested to massage her or for her to watch him shower, and that she had refused. Ms. Judd has argued that Miramax called her a “nightmare to work with” in retaliation for the hotel encounter. Miramax’s alleged conversation with Mr. Jackson occurred more than 20 years ago. The statute of limitations for a defamation claim in California is just one year, but the judge let the case go forward, saying that it was plausible that Ms. Judd would only learn about the conversation through Mr. Jackson’s 2017 interview. (The judge threw out Ms. Judd’s sexual harassment claim, saying it did not fall within the scope of California law.) Mr. Weinstein has not directly disputed the allegation that Miramax said Ms. Judd was a “nightmare to work with” but has argued that his attempts to land her major acting roles later on showed that he was not trying to hinder her career. He has denied having any nonconsensual sexual encounters, including with the two women at the center of his rape trial in Manhattan. On Monday, prosecutors in Los Angeles announced that he had been charged with rape and sexual battery in connection with encounters with two women there. In the courtroom. A defamation trial involving the formerly married actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard is currently underway in Fairfax County Circuit Court in Virginia. Here is what to know about the case: The case. Mr. Depp brought a defamation case against Ms. Heard in an effort to clear his name from domestic abuse allegations that she has made against him and that he denies. The jury is also considering a countersuit from Ms. Heard, who claims that Mr. Depp defamed her when his former lawyer said her domestic abuse claims were a “hoax.” Ms. Heard’s op-ed. Mr. Depp’s suit was filed in response to an op-ed Ms. Heard wrote for The Washington Post in 2018 in which she described herself as a “public figure representing domestic abuse.” Though she did not mention her former husband’s name, he and his lawyers have argued that she was clearly referring to their relationship. The end of their marriage. Ms. Heard filed for divorce in 2017, just over a year after the pair had married. She also obtained a temporary restraining order against the actor after accusing him of hitting her. She later withdrew that claim, and in January 2017, the couple agreed to a $7 million divorce settlement. An earlier defamation case. The trial follows another case Mr. Depp brought in London in 2020 against The Sun newspaper, which called him a “wife beater” in a headline. In that trial, a judge found that there was “overwhelming evidence” that he had assaulted Ms. Heard repeatedly during their marriage. The domestic abuse claims. In the 2020 trial, Ms. Heard accused her former husband of assaulting her first in 2013, after they began dating, and detailed other instances in which he slapped her, head-butted her and threw her to the ground. Mr. Depp has since accused her of punching him, kicking him and throwing objects at him. Compared with some other countries, in the United States a defamation case is relatively difficult to win, because of a standard set by the Supreme Court to protect freedom of the press. If the plaintiff is a public figure, as many are, he or she must prove the statement was both false and made with “reckless disregard” for whether it was true. In countries without the same high bar, including China, Australia and France, men have won high-profile defamation cases against women or news outlets that published their stories. In the United States, a court must also find that the speech in question is based in fact and not purely opinion. Part of Mr. Trump’s argument against Ms. Zervos is that his statements were “fiery rhetoric, hyperbole and opinion” that are protected by the Constitution. Mr. Moore has made a similar argument. In denying Mr. Trump’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit, a judge wrote that he knew exactly what transpired between him and Ms. Zervos, so his calling her a liar was akin to an assertion of fact. The public airing of #MeToo stories over the past two years has made these suits noticeable, but the strategy is not entirely new. In 1994, Paula Jones sued President Bill Clinton alleging that he had exposed himself to her when he was governor of Arkansas. One portion of the lawsuit accused him and his associates of defaming Ms. Jones by characterizing her as a liar. A judge dismissed the claim, writing that the comments were “mere denials of the allegations and the questioning of plaintiff’s motives.” Mr. Clinton settled the rest of the suit for $850,000, without admitting wrongdoing; his lying about his affair with Monica Lewinsky during the Jones lawsuit led to his impeachment. But a more recent ruling, by New York’s highest court, has given hope to lawyers representing women. The court in 2014 revived a lawsuit filed by two men against Jim Boeheim, the Syracuse University basketball coach, who had accused the two men of lying when they said one of Mr. Boeheim’s assistants, Bernie Fine, had abused them as children. The defamation lawsuit was settled in 2015. (Mr. Fine lost his job, but after an investigation, he was not charged with a crime.) The decision made the New York court system an attractive place to file this kind of lawsuit, said Mariann Wang, who represented the plaintiffs in that case, and Ms. Zervos until recently. Since the #MeToo movement took off, a number of states have lengthened the statutes of limitations for sexual assault claims, meaning future victims may have less need to rely on defamation lawsuits. But those suits remain the only legal option for people like Therese Serignese, who said Mr. Cosby gave her pills backstage at a show in Las Vegas in 1976, when she was 19. The next memory she had was waking up to realize that she was being sexually violated. She joined a lawsuit in 2015 asserting that representatives for Mr. Cosby had defamed her and other women by calling stories like theirs “fantastical” and “past the point of absurdity.” Mr. Cosby’s insurance company settled the lawsuit in April, about a year after he was convicted of sexual assault. “My point was to make him accountable,” Ms. Serignese, 62, said. “Put him out there and make him work to prove that I’m not telling the truth. Because I knew I was telling the truth.”","ashley judd women attach accusations sexual misconduct harvey weinstein claims account intimidating sexual advances bring weinstein court legal window

"‘London Fields’ Premiere in Toronto Troubled by Creative Rift","TORONTO — It has not been hard to spot Johnny Depp at the giant film festival here. Monday night, he walked the red carpet with his wife, Amber Heard, to celebrate a showing of his movie “Black Mass.” Two days earlier, it was Mr. Depp on Ms. Heard’s arm, at a screening of “The Danish Girl,” of which she is a star. But will they show up on Friday, when it comes time to introduce “London Fields,” in which both have roles? Even their producer doesn’t know. Based on a noir novel by Martin Amis, “London Fields,” set for its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival, has become the center of an unusually fierce, behind-the-scenes dispute over both the control and content of the movie. Whether any of the film’s biggest stars — Mr. Depp, Ms. Heard, Billy Bob Thornton and Jim Sturgess — will appear to support it on Friday is an open question, as festival organizers nervously wait to find out. None have publicly declared a boycott. But all four have written letters to their producers, objecting to a provocative cut of the movie — its narrative is now laced with violent imagery in what might be dreams, or flashes both back and forward — that was overseen not by its credited director, Mathew Cullen, but by one of those producers, Chris Hanley. Some of the actors have considered being elsewhere when the movie has its premiere on Friday, according to people with knowledge of their thinking. Mr. Cullen certainly will not be on hand, according to these people briefed on his plans, who spoke on condition of anonymity. For months Mr. Cullen and his supporters have been contending that Mr. Hanley turned “London Fields” into a sometimes unrecognizable, avant-garde experiment that violates the spirit of the project. Late Tuesday, Mr. Cullen sued Mr. Hanley in Los Angeles County Superior Court. According to the complaint, Mr. Hanley and his associates “secretly prepared their own version of the film,” which includes elements never discussed, including “incendiary imagery evoking 9/11 jumpers edited against pornography.” Among other remedies, the suit requests that a judge intervene to determine the degree to which Mr. Cullen’s name can be used in connection with the film, if at all. Filmmaker conflicts with producers and studios are hardly new. For years, the Directors Guild of America assigned an humorously anonymous “Alan Smithee” credit to troubled films like “Let’s Get Harry,” actually directed by Stuart Rosenberg, or “Solar Crisis,” from Richard Sarafian. The current contest pits a new director against a seasoned producer with a penchant for controversy. To date, Mr. Cullen, for whom “London Fields” is a first feature, has been recognized principally for his commercials, video work and a business association with Guillermo del Toro in their Mirada Studios. Mr. Hanley, who helped produce the sassy hit “Spring Breakers,” is by contrast a prolific indie filmmaker who often pushes the edges. His “American Psycho,” released in 2000, cast Christian Bale as an investment banker with a psychotic and homicidal alter-ego. Their conflict over “London Fields” has set up a potentially new embarrassment for Toronto programmers. In an emailed statement on Monday, the festival’s artistic director, Cameron Bailey, gingerly acknowledged the dispute. “We’re aware that the team that made the film is coming to agreement, and we’re looking forward to launching it,” Mr. Bailey said. Mr. Hanley, who also communicated by email, was more upbeat. “We’re very proud of the work the director did,” he wrote, noting that filmmakers as accomplished as David Cronenberg and Michael Winterbottom had unsuccessfully struggled with screen versions of Mr. Amis’s complicated, pre-apocalyptic crime thriller. Mr. Hanley said he did not know whether the actors would appear, but noted that Mr. Thornton and Ms. Heard had contractual commitments to support the film. Mr. Cullen, he said, had failed to deliver his version of the film on deadline, and continues to work on a version the “producers have not seen.” A person briefed on Mr. Cullen’s stance said the director had never been paid, and for a time paused to seek other work. Mr. Hanley said Mr. Cullen had “been fully compensated according to the terms of his agreement.” Through a representative, Mr. Cullen declined to comment. Representatives of Mr. Depp, Ms. Heard and Mr. Sturgess did not respond to queries, and a representative for Mr. Thornton did not comment. The dispute clouds a potentially prominent, star-laden project — Creative Artists Agency and IM Global are handling rights to “London Fields” — in a Toronto sales market that is still searching for bright spots. At an early press and industry screening Tuesday morning, “London Fields” — whether more Mr. Hanley’s, or Mr. Cullen’s — proved to be a sexy love quadrangle centered on the themes of clairvoyance and the decay of a London in an undefined crisis. (Mr. Hanley’s wife, Roberta Hanley, wrote the script.) In the courtroom. A defamation trial involving the formerly married actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard is currently underway in Fairfax County Circuit Court in Virginia. Here is what to know about the case: The case. Mr. Depp brought a defamation case against Ms. Heard in an effort to clear his name from domestic abuse allegations that she has made against him and that he denies. The jury is also considering a countersuit from Ms. Heard, who claims that Mr. Depp defamed her when his former lawyer said her domestic abuse claims were a “hoax.” Ms. Heard’s op-ed. Mr. Depp’s suit was filed in response to an op-ed Ms. Heard wrote for The Washington Post in 2018 in which she described herself as a “public figure representing domestic abuse.” Though she did not mention her former husband’s name, he and his lawyers have argued that she was clearly referring to their relationship. The end of their marriage. Ms. Heard filed for divorce in 2017, just over a year after the pair had married. She also obtained a temporary restraining order against the actor after accusing him of hitting her. She later withdrew that claim, and in January 2017, the couple agreed to a $7 million divorce settlement. An earlier defamation case. The trial follows another case Mr. Depp brought in London in 2020 against The Sun newspaper, which called him a “wife beater” in a headline. In that trial, a judge found that there was “overwhelming evidence” that he had assaulted Ms. Heard repeatedly during their marriage. The domestic abuse claims. In the 2020 trial, Ms. Heard accused her former husband of assaulting her first in 2013, after they began dating, and detailed other instances in which he slapped her, head-butted her and threw her to the ground. Mr. Depp has since accused her of punching him, kicking him and throwing objects at him. Decidedly nonlinear in its narrative approach, the characters, including a failed novelist played by Mr. Thornton, weave their lives in and out of literary works both past and in progress. In its present form, the narrative is intercut with images of a predatory drone, nuclear blasts, a person tumbling from a World Trade Center tower, and what appears to be a gathering in Mecca. Some of those moments were said to have outraged Mr. Cullen, according to people briefed on his response, and he explored taking his name off the film. But he found that he had missed his opportunity to do so under complicated rules enforced by the Directors Guild of America. Jovan Ajder, a sound mixer who worked on “London Fields,” speaking by telephone from London, said Mr. Hanley’s version of the movie was “radically different” from the more straightforward tale created by Mr. Cullen. “It was certainly more puzzling and confusing,” Mr. Ajder said. Even more puzzling, he said, was a production process in which Mr. Cullen edited one version of the film, while Mr. Hanley edited another, with actors on call to provide dialogue in postproduction for both. By May of this year, the actors were largely united in an unusual appeal for the restoration of Mr. Cullen’s cut (though Ms. Heard urged a merger of the versions, Mr. Hanley said). Mr. Depp, who had accepted a small role as a gesture toward his wife, was by then voicing wariness about any attempt to use him in an effort to market the movie, people briefed on the situation said. The infighting disrupted a postproduction process that was supposed to be completed in time for last year’s Toronto festival, then for the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year. Mr. Ajder was left to puzzle over a creative collision more severe than he had seen on any of the dozens of films on his résumé. “It was entirely rare, unique,” he said. But Mr. Hanley, in a Monday email, described things differently, portraying them as a familiar part of the production process. “I have been through creative battles with every film we have made with every director,” he said.","toronto hard spot johnny depp giant film festival monday night walked red carpet wife amber heard celebrate movie black mass days earlier depp ms heard arm screening danish

"‘London Fields’ Pulled From Toronto Film Festival Over Dispute","LOS ANGELES — Toronto International Film Festival officials on Thursday said they had withdrawn the film “London Fields” from their lineup because of a lawsuit filed on Tuesday by the film’s director, Mathew Cullen, against some of its producers, including Chris Hanley and his Muse Productions company. In dropping the film, festival programmers cited the legal action and “uncertainty surrounding the creative vision of the version” that had been set for a world premiere in Toronto on Friday. Mr. Hanley and a spokeswoman for the film did not immediately respond to queries. In a statement, a spokeswoman for the film said its producers called the festival cancellation “an ill-considered decision made against our rights.” The statement called Mr. Cullen’s legal complaint a “publicity stunt,” and said they would “vigorously oppose it.” “London Fields” stars Johnny Depp, Amber Heard, Billy Bob Thornton and others in a noir thriller based on a novel by Martin Amis. Mr. Cullen, in a suit filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, said its producers committed fraud by substantially changing the movie without his consent and not paying him, among other things. Another prominent film, Sydney Pollack’s documentary “Amazing Grace,” which was completed after his death in 2008, was earlier withdrawn from the festival after its subject, Aretha Franklin, filed suit challenging the right of its producers to portray her in the movie.","los angeles toronto international film festival officials thursday withdrawn film london fields lineup lawsuit filed tuesday film director mathew cullen producers including chris hanley muse productions company dropping film festival programmers cited legal action uncertainty surrounding creative vision version set world premiere toronto friday hanley spokeswoman film immediately respond queries statement spokeswoman film producers called festival cancellation ill considered decision rights statement called cullen legal complaint publicity stunt vigorously oppose london fields stars johnny depp amber heard billy bob thornton noir thriller based martin amis cullen suit filed los angeles county superior court producers committed fraud substantially changing movie consent paying prominent film sydney pollack documentary amazing grace completed death earlier withdrawn festival subject aretha franklin filed suit challenging producers portray movie"
"‘X-Men’ and ‘Looking Glass’ Disappoint at Weekend Box Office","LOS ANGELES — Moviegoers in North America have spent roughly $4.4 billion on tickets this year, a 5 percent increase over the same period in 2015. Five films have taken in more than $300 million — two is typical — and more anticipated giants are on the way, including the Pixar sequel “Finding Dory” and “Star Trek Beyond.” And yet very few Champagne corks are popping in Hollywood. Why? For a start, big-budget sequels, typically the safest route to box office success, generated ragged holiday weekend sales. “X-Men: Apocalypse” (20th Century Fox) took in an estimated $65 million between Friday and Sunday, 29 percent less than initial results for its franchise predecessor. The film delivered the sixth best opening among the eight “X-Men” movies, after taking inflation into account. Bombing was “Alice Through the Looking Glass,” which cost Walt Disney Studios $170 million to make. It took in $28.1 million, according to comScore, which compiles box office data. “We’re obviously frustrated and disappointed,” said Dave Hollis, Disney’s executive vice president for distribution. “Alice in Wonderland” arrived to $127 million in domestic ticket sales in 2010, after adjusting for inflation. But the misgivings in Hollywood extend beyond one disappointing weekend, even one as important as Memorial Day. A troubling box office trend started last summer and has only become more pronounced: The riches are not flowing evenly — four of the six major movie factories are struggling — and only expensive event films seem to be drawing crowds, with many general purpose, middle-tier movies being virtually ignored despite aggressive marketing. What seems to be succeeding are familiar and liked brands (Marvel’s “Captain America: Civil War”), bold interpretations (“Deadpool,” “The Jungle Book”) or movies that are events for a particular audience (“Miracles From Heaven,” “The Angry Birds Movie”). Increasingly lost in the mix are films aimed at older audiences or designed as alternatives to effects-driven spectacles: “The Nice Guys,” “Whiskey Tango Foxtrot,” “Money Monster,” “Mother’s Day,” “The Finest Hours,” “The Boss,” “How to Be Single,” “Hail, Caesar!” Studios have long fought through hits and misses. The worry is that audiences — unhappy with rising ticket and concession prices and increasingly bivouacked in their living rooms — seem to be saying that an entire section of studio output is no longer viable in theaters: Unless it’s a must-see movie, we’ll catch it on Netflix. Several films planned for release over the summer will either add to this concern or diminish it, including “Me Before You,” a romantic drama from New Line Cinema and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, starring Emilia Clarke of “Game of Thrones”; “Central Intelligence,” a Warner Bros. crime comedy, starring Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart; and “Free State of Jones,” a Civil War period drama from STX Entertainment, starring Matthew McConaughey. “I do still think that smart summer counterprogramming can work,” said Dan Fellman, a box office consultant who previously served as distribution chief at Warner Bros. “If you’re going to appeal to an older audience, though, you’d better have great reviews.” Some analysts aren’t so sure. Doug Creutz, a media analyst at Cowen and Company, wrote in a recent report: “With box office trends over the last 16 months suggesting that a few films are likely to take the lion’s share of the returns, it is difficult to envision a scenario in which a significant number of this summer’s releases are not money-losers, or at least disappointments.” Its failure with “Alice Through the Looking Glass” notwithstanding, Disney has been setting the studio pace by focusing on event films that trade on established brands. With smash hits like “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” “Zootopia” and “The Jungle Book,” Disney has captured about 32 percent of the domestic box office so far this year, according to the database Box Office Mojo. Hits like “Deadpool” and “Kung Fu Panda 3” have powered Fox to second place, with roughly 20 percent market share. That has left four studios — Warner, Universal, Paramount and Sony — trying to compete for the balance, and mostly waging their campaigns with lesser properties. Studio executives cautioned against reading too much into lackluster returns for “X-Men: Apocalypse” and the collapse of “Alice Through the Looking Glass,” noting that they faced different challenges. Directed by Bryan Singer, “X-Men: Apocalypse,” which cost at least $178 million to make, not including marketing, lacked some of the franchise’s major stars and received weak reviews. “This movie is going to play better than people think,” said Chris Aronson, Fox’s president of domestic distribution. “The critics lashed out, but the exit polls are very good. People like this movie.” Mr. Aronson estimated that “X-Men: Apocalypse” would take in $80 million for the four-day weekend. Overseas, the movie has collected an additional $158.8 million. “Alice Through the Looking Glass,” directed by James Bobin, received withering reviews. Disney may have taken too long to make a sequel. Certainly not helping were domestic violence accusations that emerged last week against Johnny Depp, who plays the Mad Hatter. Amber Heard, Mr. Depp’s estranged wife, appearing in Los Angeles Superior Court on Friday, received a restraining order against the actor. Mr. Depp’s lawyer, Laura Wasser, has rejected Ms. Heard’s claims, saying she is “attempting to secure a premature financial resolution by alleging abuse.” Disney had no comment about Mr. Depp’s situation and whether it contributed to the audience rejection of “Alice Through the Looking Glass.” Mr. Hollis estimated that the movie would generate $36 million over the four-day holiday. Analysts had expected at least $60 million in ticket sales.","los angeles moviegoers north america spent roughly $ billion tickets percent increase period films $ million typical anticipated giants including pixar sequel finding dory star trek champagne corks popping hollywood start budget sequels typically safest route box office success generated ragged holiday weekend sales apocalypse th century fox estimated $ million friday sunday percent initial results franchise predecessor film delivered sixth movies taking inflation account bombing alice glass cost walt disney studios $ million $ million comscore compiles box office data frustrated disappointed dave hollis disney executive vice president distribution alice wonderland arrived $ million domestic ticket sales adjusting inflation misgivings hollywood extend disappointing weekend memorial day troubling box office trend started summer pronounced riches flowing major movie factories struggling expensive event films drawing crowds purpose middle tier movies virtually aggressive marketing succeeding familiar brands marvel captain america civil war bold interpretations deadpool jungle book movies events audience miracles heaven angry birds movie increasingly lost mix films aimed audiences designed alternatives effects driven spectacles nice guys whiskey tango foxtrot money monster mother day finest hours boss single hail caesar studios fought hits misses worry audiences unhappy rising ticket concession prices increasingly bivouacked living entire section studio output viable theaters movie ll catch netflix films planned release summer add concern diminish including romantic drama line cinema metro goldwyn mayer starring emilia clarke game thrones central intelligence warner bros crime comedy starring dwayne johnson kevin hart free jones civil war period drama stx entertainment starring matthew mcconaughey smart summer counterprogramming dan fellman box office consultant previously served distribution chief warner bros appeal audience reviews analysts aren doug creutz media analyst cowen company wrote recent report box office trends months suggesting films lion share returns difficult envision scenario significant summer releases money losers disappointments failure alice glass notwithstanding disney setting studio pace focusing event films trade established brands smash hits star wars force awakens zootopia jungle book disney captured percent domestic box office database box office mojo hits deadpool kung fu panda powered fox roughly percent market share left studios warner universal paramount sony compete balance waging campaigns lesser properties studio executives cautioned reading lackluster returns apocalypse collapse alice glass noting faced challenges directed bryan singer apocalypse cost $ million including marketing lacked franchise major stars received weak reviews movie play people chris aronson fox president domestic distribution critics lashed exit polls people movie aronson estimated apocalypse $ million day weekend overseas movie collected additional $ million alice glass directed james bobin received withering reviews disney sequel helping domestic violence accusations emerged week johnny depp plays mad hatter amber heard depp estranged wife appearing los angeles superior court friday received restraining actor depp lawyer laura wasser rejected ms heard claims attempting secure premature financial resolution alleging abuse disney comment depp situation contributed audience rejection alice glass hollis estimated movie generate $ million day holiday analysts expected $ million ticket sales"
"Amber Heard Accuses ‘Belligerent’ Johnny Depp of Sexual Assault","Amber Heard described in graphic detail on Thursday how, she said, her ex-husband, Johnny Depp, beat and sexually assaulted her during a trip to Australia, during which she experienced the worst fear of her life. Ms. Heard, testifying in the defamation case filed against her by Mr. Depp, said the couple took the trip in 2015, shortly after they were married, because the actor was needed for the filming of the fifth “Pirates of the Caribbean” movie. But, while there, Mr. Depp took MDMA, became “belligerent” and attacked her, hitting her in the face, throwing her across the room, ripping off her nightgown and grabbing her by the neck, she said. “I’m looking in his eyes and I don’t see him anymore,” Ms. Heard, who sometimes broke into sobs during her testimony, said. “I’ve never been so scared in my life.” Ms. Heard described the encounter during her second day of testimony in Fairfax County Circuit Court, where she and Mr. Depp are locked in a tense legal battle over just who defamed whom. In his own testimony, Mr. Depp denied hitting Ms. Heard and denied sexually assaulting her, accusing her of being the aggressor in the relationship. The incident in Australia has emerged as a key point of contention in a trial that has focused on competing, and contradictory, accusations of spousal abuse. At some point during the confrontation Ms. Heard described, part of the middle finger on Mr. Depp’s right hand had been severed, but the couple has presented differing accounts of how it actually happened and who was to blame. Ms. Heard, 36, said Mr. Depp, 58, was angry about several issues, including his suspicion that she had been having an affair with another actor and his contention that she had been unkind to his sister. She said his attack escalated from vulgar name-calling to threats and violence. In an argument over his drinking, she said, she had thrown a liquor bottle on the ground. “That really set him off,” she said. Ms. Heard testified that during the fight, Mr. Depp threw bottles at her, missing, and that later he sexually assaulted her with a bottle. She said that, though she could not see the bottle at the time, she was later able to deduce what the object had been. According to Ms. Heard’s account, Mr. Depp severed his finger when he picked up a phone from the wall and smashed it into pieces. She said that after the attack she returned to that area of the house and found messages written on the walls and objects in the room, in blood and paint. During his testimony earlier in the trial, Mr. Depp said his finger had been severed when Ms. Heard threw a handle of vodka at him that had shattered on his hand. He said she had been upset about a meeting she had with a lawyer over a potential postnuptial agreement, and described her following him around the house, screaming obscenities and “hammering me with brutal words.” He testified that when she discovered him drinking, she hurled a bottle of vodka at him, which missed, and then another, which made contact. As his hand bled “like Vesuvius,” Mr. Depp testified, he experienced a “nervous breakdown” and used his bloody finger to write on the walls messages that “represented lies that she told me.” During her first day of testimony on Wednesday, Ms. Heard testified that Mr. Depp physically abused her throughout their relationship, recalling that his anger was triggered by suspicions she was being unfaithful, which would not abate despite her repeated denials. In his testimony, Mr. Depp had denied ever hitting Ms. Heard and accused her of being the person who resorted to violence by punching him, throwing objects at him and, once, kicking a bathroom door into his head. In court papers, Ms. Heard denied hitting Mr. Depp except in self-defense or in defense of her sister. In the courtroom. A defamation trial involving the formerly married actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard is currently underway in Fairfax County Circuit Court in Virginia. Here is what to know about the case: The case. Mr. Depp brought a defamation case against Ms. Heard in an effort to clear his name from domestic abuse allegations that she has made against him and that he denies. The jury is also considering a countersuit from Ms. Heard, who claims that Mr. Depp defamed her when his former lawyer said her domestic abuse claims were a “hoax.” Ms. Heard’s op-ed. Mr. Depp’s suit was filed in response to an op-ed Ms. Heard wrote for The Washington Post in 2018 in which she described herself as a “public figure representing domestic abuse.” Though she did not mention her former husband’s name, he and his lawyers have argued that she was clearly referring to their relationship. The end of their marriage. Ms. Heard filed for divorce in 2017, just over a year after the pair had married. She also obtained a temporary restraining order against the actor after accusing him of hitting her. She later withdrew that claim, and in January 2017, the couple agreed to a $7 million divorce settlement. An earlier defamation case. The trial follows another case Mr. Depp brought in London in 2020 against The Sun newspaper, which called him a “wife beater” in a headline. In that trial, a judge found that there was “overwhelming evidence” that he had assaulted Ms. Heard repeatedly during their marriage. The domestic abuse claims. In the 2020 trial, Ms. Heard accused her former husband of assaulting her first in 2013, after they began dating, and detailed other instances in which he slapped her, head-butted her and threw her to the ground. Mr. Depp has since accused her of punching him, kicking him and throwing objects at him. Mr. Depp’s suit contends that Ms. Heard defamed him in an op-ed piece in which she described herself as a “public figure representing domestic abuse.” Although the article did not name Mr. Depp, he has asserted that it clearly alluded to their relationship and resulted in significant damage to his acting career. Ms. Heard countersued Mr. Depp, asserting that he defamed her when a former lawyer of his made statements to the media claiming her domestic abuse allegations were a hoax. The seven-person jury is considering both lawsuits during the trial, which is taking place five years after the couple divorced. As Ms. Heard described it, Mr. Depp was a controlling presence in her life, intent on having a say over what she wore and what acting jobs she took. She testified that in 2014, he became angry about the fact that she had a romantic scene in a movie with the actor James Franco, leading to a confrontation on a private plane — one of the central incidents in dispute. On the plane, Ms. Heard said, Mr. Depp smelled of marijuana and alcohol, and he began asking her about the intimate scene with Mr. Franco, calling her a “go-getter” and suggesting that she had enjoyed it. She testified that she had tried not to engage but that Mr. Depp slapped her, threw ice cubes at her and then kicked her in the back. Eventually, she said, he locked himself in the bathroom and passed out. The incident led Ms. Heard to contemplate leaving him, she testified. “I was scared if I left him; I was scared if I didn’t,” she said. “I didn’t feel safe going home.” But Mr. Depp begged for forgiveness and promised that he was going to get sober, she said. “I got back with him on the condition that he would uphold his promise to do the treatment, to do the full detox,” Ms. Heard said. Mr. Depp gave a different version of events in his testimony. He denied having drunk excessively that day, saying he had taken two opioid pills and perhaps had a glass of champagne. Mr. Depp testified that Ms. Heard had been “actively searching for a way to instigate a fight with me” on the plane and was prodding him and heckling him, prompting him to retreat to the bathroom and fall asleep. He testified that Ms. Heard’s account of his drug and alcohol use was “grossly embellished.” There will be a break in the trial next week; Ms. Heard will resume her testimony on May 16.","amber heard graphic detail thursday husband johnny depp beat sexually assaulted trip australia experienced worst fear life ms heard testifying defamation filed depp couple trip shortly married actor filming pirates caribbean movie depp mdma belligerent attacked hitting throwing ripping nightgown grabbing neck eyes don anymore ms heard broke sobs testimony ve scared life ms heard encounter day testimony fairfax county circuit court depp locked tense legal battle defamed testimony depp denied hitting ms heard denied sexually assaulting accusing aggressor relationship incident australia emerged key contention trial focused competing contradictory accusations spousal abuse confrontation ms heard middle finger depp hand severed couple differing accounts happened blame ms heard depp angry issues including suspicion affair actor contention unkind sister attack escalated vulgar calling threats violence argument drinking thrown liquor bottle ground set ms heard testified fight depp threw bottles missing sexually assaulted bottle bottle time deduce object ms heard account depp severed finger picked phone wall smashed pieces attack returned house found messages written walls objects blood paint testimony earlier trial depp finger severed ms heard threw handle vodka shattered hand upset meeting lawyer potential postnuptial agreement house screaming obscenities hammering brutal words testified discovered drinking hurled bottle vodka missed contact hand bled vesuvius depp testified experienced nervous breakdown bloody finger write walls messages represented lies told day testimony wednesday ms heard testified depp physically abused relationship recalling anger triggered suspicions unfaithful abate repeated denials testimony depp denied hitting ms heard accused person resorted violence punching throwing objects kicking bathroom door head court papers ms heard denied hitting depp defense defense sister courtroom defamation trial involving married actors johnny depp amber heard underway fairfax county circuit court virginia depp brought defamation ms heard effort domestic abuse allegations denies jury countersuit ms heard claims depp defamed lawyer domestic abuse claims hoax ms heard op ed depp suit filed response op ed ms heard wrote washington post public figure representing domestic abuse mention husband lawyers argued referring relationship marriage ms heard filed divorce pair married obtained temporary restraining actor accusing hitting withdrew claim january couple agreed $ million divorce settlement earlier defamation trial depp brought london sun newspaper called wife beater headline trial judge found overwhelming evidence assaulted ms heard repeatedly marriage domestic abuse claims trial ms heard accused husband assaulting dating detailed instances slapped head butted threw ground depp accused punching kicking throwing objects depp suit contends ms heard defamed op ed piece public figure representing domestic abuse article depp asserted alluded relationship resulted significant damage acting career ms heard countersued depp asserting defamed lawyer statements media claiming domestic abuse allegations hoax person jury lawsuits trial taking couple divorced ms heard depp controlling presence life intent wore acting jobs testified angry romantic scene movie actor james franco leading confrontation private plane central incidents dispute plane ms heard depp smelled marijuana alcohol intimate scene franco calling getter suggesting enjoyed testified engage depp slapped threw ice cubes kicked eventually locked bathroom passed incident led ms heard contemplate leaving testified scared left scared didn didn feel safe home depp begged forgiveness promised sober condition uphold promise treatment detox ms heard depp version events testimony denied drunk excessively day opioid pills glass champagne depp testified ms heard actively searching instigate fight plane prodding heckling prompting retreat bathroom fall asleep testified ms heard account drug alcohol grossly embellished break trial week ms heard resume testimony"
"Amber Heard Testifies About a ‘Pattern’ of Violence by Johnny Depp","Amber Heard, an actress defending herself against a defamation lawsuit filed by her ex-husband, Johnny Depp, took the stand on Wednesday, recalling how a whirlwind romance that started on a movie set descended into a “pattern” of violence perpetrated against her by the actor. The couple first got to know each other in 2009 on the set of “The Rum Diary,” a movie that Mr. Depp produced and starred in, and they fell in love on the movie’s press tour, Ms. Heard testified. But by 2012, she said, Mr. Depp was repeatedly accusing her of infidelity and his anger would often escalate to physical attacks, despite her denials. “He would explode,” Ms. Heard said, recounting how Mr. Depp would punch walls next to her head, shove her to the ground and slap her repetitively. Ms. Heard often grew emotional during her testimony as she explained the physical confrontations in graphic terms, at times appearing chagrined as she gave reasons for staying in the relationship despite her misgivings. “He was the love of my life,” Ms. Heard said. “But he was also this other thing. And that other thing was awful.” In four days of testimony earlier in the trial at Fairfax County Circuit Court, Mr. Depp denied ever hitting Ms. Heard or any other woman. He accused her of being the aggressor in the relationship, describing instances in which he said she punched him and threw objects at him. But Ms. Heard has also denied ever hitting Mr. Depp, except in self-defense or in defense of her sister, and she provided a very different account of their relationship, which ended in divorce in 2017. In her account, it was Mr. Depp who would often erupt into fits of jealous rage, especially when he had been using drugs or alcohol. Once in 2013, Ms. Heard recalled, Mr. Depp accused her of an affair and then slapped her with the back of his hand, on which he wore rings. “I remember kind of just feeling like my lip went into my teeth,” she testified, “and it got a little blood on the wall.” The trial revolves around an op-ed from Ms. Heard, published by The Washington Post in 2018, in which she described herself as a “public figure representing domestic abuse.” Mr. Depp sued Ms. Heard over the op-ed, saying that even if the article did not name him, it was clearly alluding to their relationship, and that its publication had a devastating effect on his movie career. Ms. Heard, 36, countersued Mr. Depp, 58, alleging that he defamed her when his former lawyer released statements saying her allegations of abuse were a hoax. In the first three weeks of the trial, Mr. Depp’s lawyers called witnesses with the intention of proving that Ms. Heard’s domestic abuse claims were fictions that had severely damaged Mr. Depp’s career. They have also sought to prove that Ms. Heard was the primary abuser, playing audio of the couple discussing an incident in which Mr. Depp said Ms. Heard kicked a bathroom door into his head. Ms. Heard’s lawyers have argued that her statements in the op-ed are true, and that even if the jury determines it doesn’t have enough evidence to show Mr. Depp physically abused Ms. Heard, “domestic abuse” can include verbal and emotional abuse as well. “If Mr. Depp abused Ms. Heard physically, verbally, emotionally or psychologically, even one time, then she wins,” said Ben Rottenborn, a lawyer for Ms. Heard, in court on Monday. “It’s that simple.” But Ms. Heard testified that Mr. Depp abused her far more than once. The first time he hit her, she said, was about two years before they were married, when the actress laughed at one of his tattoos. He slapped her across the face three times, she said, a gesture so stunning that she initially responded with a laugh because she thought it must have been a joke. But when he objected to her laughing, she said she realized he had not been jesting and just stared at him silently. Soon Mr. Depp began crying, she said, and got down on his knees to tell her, “I thought I put the monster away.” In the courtroom. A defamation trial involving the formerly married actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard is currently underway in Fairfax County Circuit Court in Virginia. Here is what to know about the case: The case. Mr. Depp brought a defamation case against Ms. Heard in an effort to clear his name from domestic abuse allegations that she has made against him and that he denies.

Mr. Depp has since accused her of punching him, kicking him and throwing objects at him. Ms. Heard remembered going to her car, leaning her head against the window and sitting there for a while before she drove home. Days later, she said, Mr. Depp was calling and texting to apologize profusely for what had happened, and then showed up with a couple cases of wine and said it would “never happen again.” “I knew it was wrong and I knew that I had to leave him,” Ms. Heard testified, “and that’s what broke my heart because I didn’t want to leave him.” In his testimony, Mr. Depp had denied slapping her, saying, “I’m certainly not going to strike a woman if she decides to make fun of a tattoo I have on my body.” Another time, Ms. Heard testified, Mr. Depp engaged in an invasive search of her body for drugs that he thought she was hiding from him. That search occurred after Mr. Depp had smashed objects in a trailer where the couple was vacationing, enraged that another woman who was with them had gotten too close physically to Ms. Heard, she said. (In his testimony, Mr. Depp said the woman had been “very affectionate” with Ms. Heard and so he had removed the woman’s hand from Ms. Heard. That led to an argument later between the couple in their trailer, during which he said he punched a sconce in the bathroom.) At the beginning of her testimony, Ms. Heard said it had been difficult to sit in the courtroom as Mr. Depp presented his case, listening as her ex-husband and others testified about their tumultuous relationship. “This is the most painful and difficult thing I have ever gone through,” Ms. Heard said.","amber heard actress defending defamation lawsuit filed husband johnny depp stand wednesday recalling whirlwind romance started movie set descended pattern violence perpetrated actor couple set rum diary movie depp produced starred fell love movie press tour ms heard testified depp repeatedly accusing infidelity anger escalate physical attacks denials explode ms heard recounting depp punch walls head shove ground slap repetitively ms heard grew emotional testimony explained physical confrontations graphic terms times appearing chagrined reasons staying relationship misgivings love life ms heard awful days testimony earlier trial fairfax county circuit court depp denied hitting ms heard woman accused aggressor relationship describing instances punched threw objects ms heard denied hitting depp defense defense sister provided account relationship divorce account depp erupt fits jealous rage drugs alcohol ms heard recalled depp accused affair slapped hand wore rings remember feeling lip teeth testified blood wall trial revolves op ed ms heard published washington post public figure representing domestic abuse depp sued ms heard op ed article alluding relationship publication devastating effect movie career ms heard countersued depp alleging defamed lawyer released statements allegations abuse hoax weeks trial depp lawyers called witnesses intention proving ms heard domestic abuse claims fictions severely damaged depp career sought prove ms heard primary abuser playing audio couple discussing incident depp ms heard kicked bathroom door head ms heard lawyers argued statements op ed true jury determines doesn evidence depp physically abused ms heard domestic abuse include verbal emotional abuse depp abused ms heard physically verbally emotionally psychologically time wins ben rottenborn lawyer ms heard court monday simple ms heard testified depp abused time hit married actress laughed tattoos slapped times gesture stunning initially responded laugh joke objected laughing realized jesting stared silently depp crying knees monster courtroom defamation trial involving married actors johnny depp amber heard underway fairfax county circuit court virginia depp brought defamation ms heard effort domestic abuse allegations denies jury countersuit ms heard claims depp defamed lawyer domestic abuse claims hoax ms heard op ed depp suit filed response op ed ms heard wrote washington post public figure representing domestic abuse mention husband lawyers argued referring relationship marriage ms heard filed divorce pair married obtained temporary restraining actor accusing hitting withdrew claim january couple agreed $ million divorce settlement earlier defamation trial depp brought london sun newspaper called wife beater headline trial judge found overwhelming evidence assaulted ms heard repeatedly marriage domestic abuse claims trial ms heard accused husband assaulting dating detailed instances slapped head butted threw ground depp accused punching kicking throwing objects ms heard remembered car leaning head window sitting drove home days depp calling texting apologize profusely happened couple wine happen wrong leave ms heard testified broke heart didn leave testimony depp denied slapping strike woman decides fun tattoo body time ms heard testified depp engaged invasive search body drugs hiding search occurred depp smashed objects trailer couple vacationing enraged woman close physically ms heard testimony depp woman affectionate ms heard removed woman hand ms heard led argument couple trailer punched sconce bathroom beginning testimony ms heard difficult sit courtroom depp listening husband testified tumultuous relationship painful difficult ms heard"
"Amber Heard Won’t Be Jailed Over Bringing 2 Dogs to Australia","SYDNEY, Australia — The actress Amber Heard avoided jail time after a court appearance on Monday over allegations that she had illegally brought two dogs into Australia last year, violating the country’s quarantine laws, while visiting her husband, the actor Johnny Depp. Ms. Heard pleaded guilty in Southport Magistrates Court in Queensland to providing false information on her incoming passenger card after she and the dogs had landed on the Gold Coast on April 21, 2015, to visit Mr. Depp. He was there filming the fifth movie in the “Pirates of the Caribbean” series. Prosecutors dropped more serious charges against Ms. Heard that claimed that she had illegally imported the dogs, Yorkshire terriers named Pistol and Boo, which could have resulted in a two-year jail term and a fine of 20,000 Australian dollars, or about $15,350. The couple also produced a video acknowledging their transgression and urging others to obey the law, which is intended to prevent the spread of rabies and other diseases. Ms. Heard acknowledged that she had disembarked from her private jet without declaring the dogs, which arrived with her. Her lawyer, Jeremy Kirk, said Ms. Heard, 29, thought that Mr. Depp’s staff had handled the paperwork for the pets. She was sleep-deprived and exhausted, he said. Mr. Depp and Ms. Heard appeared in the local courthouse, where hers was just one of more than 200 cases listed for the day. Fans, some with dogs dressed for the occasion, lined the sidewalk hoping to see the celebrities. In court, the couple handed over their video. “Australia is a wonderful island with a treasure trove of unique animals, plants and people,” Ms. Heard said. The dogs came to the attention of the authorities after a groomer posted photographs of them on social media in May. By then, they had been in the country for around three weeks. The agriculture minister, Barnaby Joyce, told Mr. Depp that unless the dogs were taken out of the country within 72 hours, they would be euthanized. Like many countries, Australia requires that animals be placed in quarantine upon arrival. “If we start letting movie stars — even though they have been the sexiest man alive twice — to come into our nation” with pets, said Mr. Joyce, now the deputy prime minister, “then why don’t we just break the laws for everybody?” The dogs, he said, should return to the United States. The couple returned to California but publicly criticized the Australian government as being overly zealous, setting off a controversy that the local news media called the “War on Terrier.”","sydney australia actress amber heard avoided jail time court appearance monday allegations illegally brought dogs australia violating country quarantine laws visiting husband actor johnny depp ms heard pleaded guilty southport magistrates court queensland providing false information incoming passenger card dogs landed gold coast april visit depp filming movie pirates caribbean series prosecutors dropped charges ms heard claimed illegally imported dogs yorkshire terriers named pistol boo resulted jail term fine australian dollars $ couple produced video acknowledging transgression urging obey law intended prevent spread rabies diseases ms heard acknowledged disembarked private jet declaring dogs arrived lawyer jeremy kirk ms heard depp staff handled paperwork pets sleep deprived exhausted depp ms heard appeared local courthouse listed day fans dogs dressed occasion lined sidewalk hoping celebrities court couple handed video australia wonderful island treasure trove unique animals plants people ms heard dogs attention authorities groomer posted photographs social media country weeks agriculture minister barnaby joyce told depp dogs country hours euthanized countries australia requires animals quarantine arrival start letting movie stars sexiest alive nation pets joyce deputy prime minister don break laws dogs return united couple returned california publicly criticized australian government overly zealous setting controversy local news media called war terrier"
"Angelina Jolie Turns to Divorce Specialist Laura Wasser","In her hour of need, Angelina Jolie Pitt turned to the hard-charging Los Angeles divorce lawyer known to TMZ readers and viewers as “the disso queen,” the word “disso” being short for dissolution of marriage. “I guess you could say I am unorthodox,” said Laura Wasser, who, in addition to movie stars like Ms. Jolie Pitt and Johnny Depp, counsels an eclectic mix of athletes, musicians and reality-show stars, including a Kardashian or three. Perhaps the earliest inkling that she had a knack for negotiating on behalf of another was when she was 9 years old and marched into her parents’ living room, yellow legal pad and pencil in hand, and demanded that they give her younger brother an allowance. She got her brother money, said her father, Dennis Wasser, himself a well-known divorce lawyer who has counseled celebrity clients. “And she took a percentage of it, too,” Mr. Wasser added. Like her father before her, Ms. Wasser, a weekend surfer with a weekday penchant for sky-high stilettos, has become one of Hollywood’s most sought-after advisers. In recent days, she has been pulling out all the stops on behalf of Ms. Jolie Pitt, who on Monday filed for divorce from Brad Pitt, demanding sole physical custody of their six children. Ms. Wasser’s name appears above that of her famous petitioner on the papers filed with Superior Court of California in Los Angeles County. The legal grounds given for the divorce are irreconcilable differences. Ms. Wasser, 48, represented Mr. Depp in his messy split from the actress Amber Heard. (Ms. Heard is giving her settlement to charity.) She has also counseled the actress Jennifer Garner, who last year separated from Ben Affleck amid rumors that he had grown too close with the nanny. Those cases follow a number of instances in which Ms. Wasser worked on behalf of high-profile women, including the singer Gwen Stefani, who split last year from the musician Gavin Rossdale, and Maria Shriver, who left the actor and former governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2011 after he admitted to an affair with a housekeeper with whom, it turned out, he secretly had a son. For Ms. Wasser, the appetite for celebrity gossip has compounded the challenge of managing clients who value personal privacy but, at the same time, seek to influence interested onlookers. “You won’t see her talking about her clients, because she will lose those clients,” said Jonathan Wolfe, part of the legal team that represented Katie Holmes in her divorce from Tom Cruise. Ms. Wasser said she seeks to move “quickly and quietly,” preferring to settle her cases out of the spotlight. Handling the sensitive matters that inevitably surface in such cases out of the news media glare satisfies her image-conscious clients, she said, while also pleasing their managers, lawyers and talent agents, all of whom prefer that their clients not be so hamstrung by legal proceedings and online gossip that they have trouble reporting to a film set. “Representatives value when their clients are working,” Ms. Wasser said. “That’s how they make their living, by getting their percentage.” A longtime student of celebrity culture, Ms. Wasser was raised in Los Angeles and graduated from Beverly Hills High School in 1986. Others there at the time included Pauly Shore, David Schwimmer and the “Orange Is the New Black” creator Jenji Kohan. “She partied with the hot kids in high school,” her father said. In 1994, she earned her law degree from Loyola Law School, and she put her J.D. to use as a disability-rights lawyer before joining her father’s firm, Wasser, Cooperman & Mandles. At the time, Ms. Wasser was newly divorced and vowed never to remarry. She has two sons by different fathers. Brian Grazer, the Academy Award-winning producer of “A Beautiful Mind,” met Ms. Wasser in the mid-1990s. He had asked her father, who had represented Steven Spielberg and Clint Eastwood in their divorce cases, to serve as a consultant on “Liar, Liar,” a 1997 Jim Carrey comedy about a double-talking lawyer newly compelled to tell nothing but the truth. But when Mr. Grazer arrived on the set, Mr. Wasser was nowhere to be found. “Instead, there was this superattractive girl,” he said. “She said, ‘I’m Dennis Wasser’s daughter.’” Mr. Grazer brushed her off at first. But as he got to know her, he found that “she was cool, smart and user-friendly,” he said. (“User-friendly” is Hollywood code for no drama.) In 2006, when Mr. Grazer was on the verge of a divorce from his third wife, the novelist Gigi Levangie Grazer, he turned to Ms. Wasser. By then, she had made a name for herself. In 2001, along with the famed lawyer Johnnie Cochran Jr., she represented the singer Stevie Wonder after his former girlfriend claimed he gave her herpes. The case went to mediation. Two years later, Ms. Jolie Pitt hired her when she sought a divorce from Billy Bob Thornton. Ms. Wasser said she met Ms. Jolie Pitt through David Weber, a business partner of Ms. Jolie Pitt’s entertainment lawyer, Robert Offer. Mr. Weber is also a former beau of Ms. Wasser’s and the father of one of her sons. “Those guys are family,” Ms. Wasser said, referring to Mr. Weber and Mr. Offer. “They don’t want to deal with that icky, messy stuff. That’s because they are with their clients for life. For me, it’s six to 12 months.” Mr. Offer is the lawyer who gave the press statement on Tuesday that set off an explosion of social media commentary and online traffic. “This decision was made for the health of the family,” Mr. Offer said. “She will not be commenting and asks that the family be given its privacy at this time.” The language was formal but barbed, with its suggestion that the “health of the family” was somehow imperiled. After her initial foray with Ms. Jolie Pitt at the time of her split from Mr. Thornton, Ms. Wasser went on to help Britney Spears through the end of her marriage to the backup dancer Kevin Federline; Robyn Moore at the time of her divorce from Mel Gibson; Ryan Reynolds, when his marriage to Scarlett Johansson was coming to an end; and Kim Kardashian, who was through with the basketball player Kris Humphries. Along the way, Ms. Wasser earned a reputation for hammering out settlements without going to trial. She said that she counsels celebrities to “go on lockdown” when their cases are drawing news media attention. “She is very direct,” said Sayre Victoria Ziskin, a friend and an interior designer who decorated Ms. Wasser’s home and office. “She’s not wishy-washy. She knows what she wants and she goes for it.” Ms. Wasser spends most weekends in Malibu with her two sons. She is on the advisory board for the Harriett Buhai Center for Family Law, which supports victims of domestic violence. And she cops to being a clotheshorse, having been photographed most recently in Porter magazine in a salmon Oscar de la Renta dress and Christian Louboutin heels, her brunette tresses cascading over her shoulders. She charges $850 an hour for her services and insisted that she eschews the role of therapist or after-hours drinking companion for her famous clients. “I cost too much,” she said. “I don’t believe they want to hang out with me. I have my own friends.” She said that she had not seen Ms. Jolie Pitt for years until they reconnected last week. Still, she commands a certain loyalty. Of Mr. Grazer, she said, “I’m a good girlfriend to him.” In 2012, Mr. Wonder interviewed Ms. Wasser for Interview magazine, asking about her work, including how to handle the tabloid media. “I’ve definitely had cases where one side or the other is completely playing to the media and not really focusing on the matter at hand,” she told him. Ms. Jolie Pitt is known for carefully crafting a public image. She and Mr. Pitt have successfully brokered the sale of personal photographs to publications like People and Time, with the proceeds going to charity. Ms. Jolie Pitt has also asked that magazines not refer to the couple as “Brangelina.” That is why some observers paused when the gossip website TMZ, founded by the lawyer Harvey Levin, broke the divorce story Tuesday morning in a report that included Mr. Offer’s statement. “What she is trying to do is frame the narrative,” the lawyer Gloria Allred said of Ms. Jolie Pitt and her representatives. “When there is a vacuum of information, there is a lot of speculation.” The tabloid press began churning out minute-to-minute stories, quoting unnamed sources claiming to know why the marriage fell apart. While saying that she prefers to do her job away from the spotlight, Ms. Wasser is certainly not media-shy. She has been profiled in Vanity Fair, Vogue, Elle and Bloomberg Businessweek. During an interview Thursday, she pitched a new app she is developing for people who want a do-it-yourself divorce. Ms. Wasser is friendly with the gossip kingpin Mr. Levin, saying she met him when they spoke at a conference during which she argued that divorce documents should be sealed. (Mr. Levin did not agree.) The two have been photographed at numerous events, including at a party for Ms. Wasser’s 2013 book, “It Doesn’t Have to Be That Way: How to Divorce Without Destroying Your Family or Bankrupting Yourself.” Mr. Levin, whose organization has dominated the Jolie Pitt story thus far, declined to be interviewed for this article. Asked if she was feeding the TMZ beast, Ms. Wasser said: “I do not talk to the press. Even Harvey. I’ll talk about me. I’ll talk about my clothes. But I don’t talk about my clients.”","hour angelina jolie pitt hard charging los angeles divorce lawyer tmz readers viewers disso queen word disso short dissolution marriage guess unorthodox laura

"Depp’s Pets and the Oz Pol","SYDNEY — POOR little Pistol and Boo. The fate of the dogs that the actor Johnny Depp and his wife, the actress Amber Heard, flew undeclared into Australia last year, thereby inciting a diplomatic incident, seems uncertain now that their owners have separated. Back in Los Angeles, Ms. Heard, who has also accused Mr. Depp of assaulting her, applied for custody of Pistol; it is unclear what will happen to Boo. A further, unforeseen consequence of the smuggling of these teacup Yorkshire terriers via private jet is its possible impact on our approaching national election. Mr. Depp’s public row with the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, over the country’s biosecurity laws could even end up oiling the path for the conservative government to retain power. In the verbal jousting between the politician and the actor, it is the politician who has been winning, ridiculing Mr. Depp’s air of entitlement. At first, it was all just funny. The dogs were so small, their names so improbable, the likelihood of their posing a threat to our wildlife so implausible that we laughed, hard. But we stopped when it became clear that Mr. Depp’s behavior stemmed from two obnoxious attitudes: First, that our far-off country’s rules about importing animals were ridiculous; and second, that he should be exempted from the scrutiny mere mortals faced. Mr. Depp is hardly alone in wanting to travel with animals, and flying a pet across borders is often fraught. Happily for those flying from Australia to the United States, no quarantine is required. When my family brought our chocolate Labrador, Hugo, to New York, the worst of it was that he arrived in a deep fog of jet lag. Returning to Australia, though, is another matter. Animals must go through an elaborate process, involving an extended quarantine during which visits from owners are not permitted, before the pets are allowed home. To enter the country, they need to be microchipped, vaccinated against rabies and several other diseases, treated for parasites and examined by a veterinarian; their owners must also pay for an import license and book quarantine accommodation. It’s a pain, but we all have to do it. And it has ensured that Australian animals are free of rabies, whereas in America the disease is endemic; even raccoons in New York’s Central Park have carried it. So when Ms. Heard smuggled two dogs onto a private plane and sneaked them into the country, without alerting authorities, while Mr. Depp was filming here in April 2015, the couple wasn’t just annoying pedantic bureaucrats; they were violating laws. Enter Mr. Joyce, then Australia’s agriculture minister. The maverick politician played to the camera with relish, announcing that he had a message for “a gentleman by the name of John Christopher Depp, 51 years old, a.k.a. Jack Sparrow.” Warning that the dogs could be euthanized if they stayed here, he declared: “It’s time that Pistol and Boo buggered off back to the United States.” Spoken like a true Australian. “If we start letting movie stars,” Mr. Joyce told ABC radio, “even though they’ve been the Sexiest Man Alive twice,” violate the rules on bringing animals in, “then why don’t we just break the laws for everybody?” Shortly afterward, Pistol and Boo did jet out of the country, leaving their owners to face a fine of more than $15,000 or a possible two-year prison term. Ms. Heard had to appear in court charged on two counts of illegally importing the dogs and one count of producing a false document (her lawyer said this was an error). Mr. Depp was affronted. In September, at the Venice Film Festival, he joked: “I killed my dogs and ate them under direct orders from some kind of, I don’t know, sweaty, big-gutted man from Australia.” Nice. Meanwhile, Ms. Heard pleaded guilty to falsifying her documents, and the other charges were dropped. She received a good behavior bond. As part of the deal, the pair then released a video apology, ostensibly to pay tribute to Australia’s biosecurity laws. “Australians are unique,” said Mr. Depp, “both warm and direct.” The couple’s sardonic, deadpan expressions and loaded, sarcastic lines made us roar with laughter again. Mr. Joyce scoffed, “I don’t think he’ll get an Academy Award.” But he expressed himself satisfied that the message about our strict laws was “going off like a frog in a sock” around the world. Mr. Depp’s resentment remained palpable. He told Jimmy Kimmel that Mr. Joyce “looks somehow inbred with a tomato.” Australians have dozens of words for people who consider themselves better than others — poseurs, tossers, people who “have tickets on themselves” — so strongly rooted is egalitarianism in our culture. We understand the challenge to authority, but not if someone considers himself superior to the rest of us. Asked to respond once more, Mr. Joyce advised the movie star to move on. “Long after I’ve forgotten about Mr. Depp,” he said, “he’s remembering me.” The once sexiest man alive has been felled by the most mortal of pains: shame and heartbreak. Worse, he now faces a damaging allegation of domestic violence. Finally, when he learned of Ms. Heard’s filing for divorce, our deputy prime minister turned serious. “The one thing I will never revel in is any relationship breakdown, no matter what animosity that might be seen on the airwaves between Mr. Depp and myself,” he said. “No, I would never, ever revel in something like that.” Even red-faced, big-gutted politicians can have flashes of grace.","sydney poor pistol boo fate dogs actor johnny depp wife actress amber heard flew undeclared australia inciting diplomatic incident uncertain owners separated los angeles ms heard accused depp assaulting applied custody pistol unclear happen boo unforeseen consequence smuggling teacup yorkshire terriers private jet impact approaching national election depp public row deputy prime minister barnaby joyce country biosecurity laws oiling path conservative government retain power verbal jousting politician actor politician winning ridiculing depp air entitlement funny dogs names improbable likelihood posing threat wildlife implausible laughed hard stopped depp behavior stemmed obnoxious attitudes country rules importing animals ridiculous exempted scrutiny mere mortals faced depp travel animals flying pet borders fraught happily flying australia united quarantine required family brought chocolate labrador hugo york worst arrived deep fog jet lag returning australia matter animals elaborate process involving extended quarantine visits owners permitted pets allowed home enter country microchipped vaccinated rabies diseases treated parasites examined veterinarian owners pay import license book quarantine accommodation pain ensured australian animals free rabies america disease endemic raccoons york central park carried ms heard smuggled dogs private plane sneaked country alerting authorities depp filming april couple wasn annoying pedantic bureaucrats violating laws enter joyce australia agriculture minister maverick politician played camera relish announcing message gentleman john christopher depp jack sparrow warning dogs euthanized stayed declared time pistol boo buggered united spoken true australian start letting movie stars joyce told abc radio ve sexiest alive violate rules bringing animals don break laws shortly afterward pistol boo jet country leaving owners fine $ prison term ms heard court charged counts illegally importing dogs count producing false document lawyer error depp affronted september venice film festival joked killed dogs ate direct don sweaty gutted australia nice ms heard pleaded guilty falsifying documents charges dropped received behavior bond deal pair released video apology ostensibly pay tribute australia biosecurity laws australians unique depp warm direct couple sardonic deadpan expressions loaded sarcastic lines roar laughter joyce scoffed don ll academy award expressed satisfied message strict laws frog sock world depp resentment remained palpable told jimmy kimmel joyce inbred tomato australians dozens words people poseurs tossers people tickets strongly rooted egalitarianism culture understand challenge authority considers superior rest respond joyce advised movie star move ve forgotten depp remembering sexiest alive felled mortal pains shame heartbreak worse damaging allegation domestic violence finally learned ms heard filing divorce deputy prime minister revel relationship breakdown matter animosity airwaves depp revel red faced gutted politicians flashes grace"
"Elon Musk, Blasting Off in Domestic Bliss","So how do the King of Mars, his Galactic Princess and their newborn son, X Æ A-Xii, spend a Saturday night holed up in their Los Angeles pad? A little anime — lately it’s been “Death Note” and “Evangelion.” Lots of late-night debates about the potential and danger of artificial intelligence. And many audiobooks and podcasts, particularly ones about history. “Right now, we’re going back to Genghis Khan for like the third time, and the Mongols, I guess,” said the Galactic Princess, otherwise known as Grimes, otherwise known as Claire Boucher, otherwise known as “c,” her initial and the symbol for the speed of light. “You seem to be obsessed with that,” she teased her boyfriend about Genghis Khan. Grimes, the singer and artist, and Elon Musk, the rocket man and Tesla magnate, have an otherworldly romance. Which works out well since Mr. Musk wants to occupy Mars, in case malevolent robots or an engineered virus threaten Earth, and then die on Mars, just not on impact. The couple has a baby with the most unusual name, which they shorten to “X.” Mr. Musk said it’s pronounced “just like the letter X. AE is pronounced ‘ash’, as in Old English. A-12 is also pronounced just like it reads. Refers to the Archangel-12 C.I.A. reconnaissance plane.” At the mention of his status as the prince of the internet, with memes about how he cries in old-school A.O.L. dial-up tones, X begins crying. (From what I could hear, it sounded pretty human.) “Oh, X,"" c said sweetly, when the baby wailed. She said she calls her son “Little X,” and Mr. Musk chimed in, “Lil Nas X.” (“Who is actually the greatest memer,’’ Grimes said of the rapper.) Mr. Musk, a digital prankster who loves mixing it up with his fans, has tweeted a picture with a tattoo filter on his son’s face, responding to one admirer, “Never too young for some ink haha.” I had an hourlong phone interview with Mr. Musk, 49, who has been bouncing around in the Top 10 list of richest Earthlings, and for a few moments he drew in Grimes for a cameo. His personal life has been as vertiginous as his professional life: married three times, twice to the same woman, Talulah Riley, an actress who played a lethal sexbot on “Westworld.” He has six children. And he had a high-profile romance with Amber Heard, leading to his name being dragged through the sensational London libel trial pitting Ms. Heard against her former husband, Johnny Depp — a legal morass that makes the attenuated “Bleak House” case of “Jarndyce and Jarndyce” seem short and sweet. “I definitely was not having an affair with Amber while she was married to Johnny, this is totally false,” Mr. Musk said, disputing Mr. Depp’s claim. About the contention that he had a threesome with Ms. Heard and her friend Cara Delevingne, Mr. Musk said, laughing, “We did not have the threesome, you know. So I think people think these things are generally more salacious than they are.” He has some advice for Mr. Depp and Ms. Heard: “For the two of them, I would just recommend that they bury the hatchet and move on.” Asked about Mr. Depp’s deprecation of him as “Mollusk,"" Mr. Musk chuckled again, saying: “Well, yeah, I hope he recovers from this situation.” I noted that the actor employed some smack talk worthy of a pirate in a text message to Ms. Heard that was read in court, threatening to slice off a sensitive part of Mr. Musk’s anatomy. “If Johnny wants a cage fight, just let me know,” Mr. Musk said mischievously, breaking into his famous giggle. Now comes an intriguing romance with Grimes, 32, who when she was pregnant floated in ethereal cyber-goth images by Charlotte Rutherford for a Rolling Stone digital cover. (The story, by Brian Hiatt, described Grimes’s Targaryen blanket and her description of herself and the baby as nocturnal creatures.) A fan on her Reddit page described her as a hybrid of a fairy, a witch and a cyborg — pretty much Mr. Musk’s dream girl — and she has talked about going through a Wiccan phase in seventh grade. “Yeah, she’s pretty special, that’s for sure,” Mr. Musk said, with his lilting South African accent. “She’s one of the most unusual people I’ve ever met.” I wonder how it works with two such exotic birds. “We’ve had this debate of ‘Are you more crazy than me or am I more crazy than you?’” Mr. Musk said. Certainly, the titan can be a romantic. He courted Ms. Riley by lavishing her with 500 roses and a gospel choir to serenade her. Visibly distraught over his breakup with Ms. Heard in 2017, he told Neil Strauss in a Rolling Stone cover story: “If I’m not in love, if I’m not with a long-term companion, I cannot be happy.” He added that he needed a soul mate because he hates “being in a big empty house, and the footsteps echoing through the hallway, no one there — and no one on the pillow next to you.” Grimes and Mr. Musk made their public debut at the Met Gala in 2018, which had a Catholic theme. “She was wearing a head piece made of Vantablack, the blackest black that anything could be,” he recalled to me. “There was only one person who noticed and that was Stephen Colbert. On the back of my tuxedo jacket — which was sort of like an inverted priest jacket with the jacket being white and the collar being black — I had in big, black, gothic script, “Novus ordo seclorum.” (Often translated as “New secular order,” the maxim on the dollar bill.) I love how-people-met stories, but this was the wildest one I’d ever heard: Two famous people who thought they were crazy when they were little because there were so many off-the-wall ideas bursting out of their heads somehow found each other. Mr. Musk, who spent years warning that his friends in Silicon Valley, like Google’s Larry Page, may inadvertently be “summoning the demon” and creating killer robots or an invisible evil A.I. that would wipe out humanity, was about to tweet a pun about a thought experiment called Roko’s Basilisk, about a wicked A.I. who tortures those who didn’t help it become our overlord. Intending to make a pun about Rococo Basilisk, he was Googling for an image of a basilisk with a rococo flair when he came across a 2015 music video for “Flesh Without Blood,” in which Grimes dresses as a rococo basilisk. “And then it’s like, whoa, someone’s done a music video of this?” Mr. Musk recalled. “It wasn’t a joke to me, actually,” Grimes weighed in. Mr. Musk laughed, agreeing, “Rococo basilisk is no joke!” “I just thought it sounded prettier than Roko’s Basilisk, like adding a rococo element just elevates it,” she said. “I would like to make it less terrifying by making fun of it because you just can’t be terrifying if you’re rococo,” he said. “It’s this oddly ornate sort of French 1800s, 1700s, architecture. It’s just like rococo is party flair.” Grimes, who put a Marie Antoinette spin on her costume for that video, begged to differ. “Rococo is kind of terrifying because it does represent the ultimate sort of like bourgeois-like, elite-like — it’s literally the point of being rococo is like art for the sake of sheer, ornamental and useless as possible. I believe that’s actually like a philosophical aspect of the art form so, I mean. …” “It’s festive,” he agreed. “It’s super-festive but there’s a darkness to it,” she continued. “It’s the ultimate sort of bourgeois.” Her boyfriend bantered back: “I think your use of the term ‘bourgeois’ is fundamentally bourgeois.” Mr. Musk said that “c has gotten quite worried about A.I. in the last few weeks. I think GPT-3” — the latest A.I. tool that has Silicon Valley buzzing — “has caused her to become quite concerned. And I’m like, ‘Welcome to me circa 10 years ago.’” They also have Canada in common. Grimes was raised there, and Mr. Musk immigrated there from South Africa at 17. He jokes that if X isn’t the prince of the internet, he can be “the prince of Canada.” What is it like being a father again at this age? “I think babies are supercool and really people need to have more babies because, it sounds obvious, but if people don’t have enough babies, humanity will disappear,” he said. But how does he have any time to spend with his children, given his insane work schedule? “Well, babies are just eating and pooping machines, you know?” he said. “Right now there’s not much I can do. Grimes has a much bigger role than me right now. When the kid gets older, there will be more of a role for me. I think just doing what I’ve done with my other kids. If I have a trip for Tesla to China, for example, I’ll bring the kids with me and we’ll go see the Great Wall or we took the bullet train from Beijing to Xian and saw the Terracotta Warriors.” He created an online school for his older kids, which he said has “actually worked out pretty well.” I asked Mr. Musk, who has given money to both Democratic and Republican candidates, if Grimes, who supported Bernie Sanders, had an influence on his recent decision to disencumber himself of his houses, including a quirky one once owned by Gene Wilder. “Well,"" he said, “she thinks I should hold on to at least one house.” So he’s ready to be a homeless billionaire? Laughing, he mused, “I guess we’ll just rent a place somewhere? And yeah, in some ways, possessions weigh you down. And also, I just have all these houses but nobody is using them. I use them infrequently. In the Bay Area, for example from 2002 to 2017, I never owned a house and I was there half the week so I would either sleep at the factory or in a friend’s spare bedroom or on a couch or in a hotel. I did that for 15 years.” He said he could always crash with his fellow billionaires Mr. Page and Sergey Brin. “It was actually, in retrospect, kind of good because you end up rotating through friends’ houses and you catch up with them and stay in contact, whereas these days, I have been staying in this strange Gatsby-like house, what I call the haunted mansion, and it’s a bit bleak, to be totally frank,” he said. “The house itself is beautiful but, you know, it’s like Wayne Manor without Alfred.” He had thought about designing his own “aspirational masterpiece of a house,” but decided that it would take bandwidth away from his work “getting people to Mars and environmental sustainability and accelerating stable energy.” When I mention the nickname that Kara Swisher, a New York Times tech columnist, has bestowed on him, King of Mars, he slyly gives himself a promotion: “Sure, I mean, emperor, come on.” The billionaire laughs a lot during the interview. He has come out on the other side of two of the most painful, lachrymose years that any entrepreneur could imagine, with self-inflicted wounds and schadenfreude galore. “I think I’m a little scathed, yeah,” Mr. Musk said, adding: “I mean, basically, there was a period from end of 2017 to about, I guess, the middle of last year, that was excruciating.” Peter Thiel, who helped build the company that became PayPal with Mr. Musk, told me, “He’s on top of the world. All of the people who have been shorting Tesla stock, who constitute a kind of ‘hate factory’ against the company, have been totally crushed. And that makes him very happy.” (Blowing a raspberry to his hedge fund foes, Mr. Musk produced a sold-out line of Tesla short shorts on his website for $69.420 apiece.) Mr. Musk is so transparent that he seems heedless at times, in ways that make his investors nervous and his fan boys thrilled. “The people who love him and the people who hate him are equally irrational,” said Ashlee Vance, Mr. Musk’s biographer. “It reminds me of Steve Jobs. It’s way beyond business or celebrity. It strikes me as religious, more than anything. His fans are acolytes.” (Mr. Musk is also like Mr. Jobs in his obsession with sleek design; he hates seams.) Critics called him reckless in reopening his Tesla factory in Alameda County, Calif., in early May, after it had been closed since March 23 because of the coronavirus; he dared local officials to arrest him and threatened to move the factory to Texas or Nevada. But his friends think it’s all part of the ride. They describe his internal narrative as going something like this: “I’m going to take over the world. That’s going to be a super-crazy process. And therefore, if the roller coaster ride isn’t incredibly scary, I’m doing something wrong.” And after Mr. Jobs, boards learned their lesson about pushing out visionaries in favor of gray-haired corporate suits. Tesla stock has tripled in the last several months. Mr. Musk is the first person in almost a century to come out of nowhere and create a car company with that much volume, showing other plodding car companies how electric cars can be cool, sexy and incredibly efficient. And with SpaceX, Mr. Musk provided a moment so bold and brimming with American razzmatazz that it lifted us briefly out of our pandemic-induced funk. When his Crew Dragon spacecraft launched two NASA astronauts in May from the legendary Florida pad that once served Apollo missions, it was a reminder of when America was first and fast and made things, coming at a dark time when even masks and ventilators seemed beyond our manufacturing reach and when our government appears so incapable of getting coronavirus under control that the European Union has banned Americans from coming in. As a boy, Elon loved “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy,” and now he shoots astronauts into the Milky Way. How did that moment feel? “It’s amazing,” he said. “I mean, I’m sort of seeing everything that’s wrong or could go wrong.” He has called Jeff Bezos, who has acquired a self-driving start-up and founded the space travel company, Blue Origin, a copycat, tweeting a cat emoji. “The rate of progress is too slow and the amount of years he has left is not enough, but I’m still glad he’s doing what he’s doing with Blue Origin,"" Mr. Musk said. Congress is bringing the four top tech C.E.O.s to Washington next week for an antitrust inquiry. How does Mr. Musk think Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg have handled fears about Facebook hurting democracy? “I am not super-confident,” he said. “I’m, like, not pro-Facebook. I don’t have a Facebook page. SpaceX and Tesla deleted their Facebook pages. SpaceX and Tesla do have an Instagram but I think it’s relatively harmless. So I think Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg still have a lot of work to do to restore public trust in Facebook itself.” In his spare time, Mr. Musk is working on tunnels that would alleviate urban traffic jams, an idea he dreamed up while stuck in L.A. traffic; spaceports that could catapult you from New York to Shanghai in 39 minutes; a hyperloop that would let you scoot between D.C. and New York in half an hour; a neural net that would be sewn or lasered into brains to fuse us with computers, which would potentially allow us to compete with superintelligent rogue A.I. and could also restore the ability to walk, hear, speak or see; and solar initiatives and lightweight lithium batteries to make mitigating climate change cheaper and more accessible. “I have lots of ideas, more ideas than I can act upon,” said the man who insists he is an engineer, not a businessman or investor. “I tend to bite off more than I can chew and then just sit there with chipmunk cheeks.” Indeed, Mr. Musk is a rare product of Silicon Valley who actually enjoys biting and chewing. Many people there, obsessed with living longer, chug Soylent or practice intermittent fasting, like Jack Dorsey, the chief executive of Twitter. “I love going to a restaurant that’s doing something special with food,” Mr. Musk said, “and I think really if you are not appreciating this, then you are not appreciating one of the finest things about living.” The view of Silicon Valley has grown darker in recent years, as Americans realized that the lords of the cloud who were supposed to improve our lives were carelessly harvesting our data and allowing themselves to be disinformation factories. Mr. Musk’s peers may mock him for his grandiosity and say that his worldview of good battling evil is just a smart business stance to lure the best people. And he is certainly a grandmaster at marketing and self-promotion. But he also really does want to save the world and make products that bring joy. A few years back, he deserted Silicon Valley for “Silicone Valley,” as he calls L os Angeles. Mr. Musk was painted as a Luddite, “hysterical” in the estimation of Mr. Zuckerberg, for what his friends called “Elon’s crusade,” his proselytizing that we should figure out safety features for A.I. before it gets smarter than us. He may not be as fortissimo about it, but he still feels passionately about “the A.I. warning drama game,” as he dryly put it. In the past, talking about A.I. turning on us, he has used the Monty Python line, “Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition.” “My assessment about why A.I. is overlooked by very smart people is that very smart people do not think a computer can ever be as smart as they are,” he told me. “And this is hubris and obviously false.” He adds that working with A.I. at Tesla lets him say with confidence “that we’re headed toward a situation where A.I. is vastly smarter than humans and I think that time frame is less than five years from now. But that doesn’t mean that everything goes to hell in five years. It just means that things get unstable or weird.” He said his “top concern” is DeepMind, the secretive London A.I. lab run by Demis Hassabis and owned by Google. “Just the nature of the A.I. that they’re building is one that crushes all humans at all games,” he said. “I mean, it’s basically the plotline in ‘War Games.’” In Rolling Stone, Neil Strauss posited that the billionaire’s vehemence on dangerous A.I. was inspired by his estrangement from his father: “This is the good son’s second chance against the remorseless father he couldn’t change.” When I ask Mr. Musk about it, he murmured, “Um. Well, I don’t know if it’s daddy issues, to be totally frank. I mean, independent of whether my father — who does have a lot of issues — this is very separate from that. This is just that objectively, things will be weird when the computers are way smarter than humans.” The hack last week of the Twitter accounts of Mr. Musk, Joe Biden, Barack Obama, Kanye West, Bill Gates and other celebrities in a bitcoin scam reinforced the idea that everyone’s information is at risk. “Within a few minutes of the post coming up, I immediately got texts from a bunch of people I know, then I immediately called Jack so probably within less than five minutes my account was locked,” Mr. Musk said, referring to Mr. Dorsey. Was he concerned that the hack would allow people to see his direct messages? Chortling, he said. “I’m not that concerned about my DMs being made public. I mean, we can probably cherry pick some section of my DMs that sound bad out of context but overall my DMs mostly consist of swapping memes.” What was it like for the guy who dabbled in hacking as a teenager and who lives out loud on Twitter with 37 million followers to have his favorite megaphone hijacked? “Well, I was quite ill,” he said. “I think I had food poisoning or something, so you throw up incredibly violently with food poisoning. So I was kind of ill during a lot of it, the Twitter takeover. But I think it’s good anyway to take a few breaks from Twitter and not be on there 24 hours a day. Twitter can mess with your mind.” He added: “If you’re going down a negative rabbit hole on Twitter, it can make you miserable, that’s for sure.” (As Mr. Musk learned again when he got sued for defamation, unsuccessfully, for the “pedo guy” tweet by a British cave explorer helping with the rescue of children trapped in a cave in Thailand.) His shoot-from-the-hip style on Twitter played a prominent role in what he calls the most painful period of his career. Working 120 hours a week to get out his Model 3, including 24 hours on his birthday, and feeling enormous stress from the short sellers he felt were trying to destroy Tesla, he sent out a tweet that he had “funding secured” to take his company private at $420 a share, even though it was premature. He said he rounded that number up from $419 in part to amuse Grimes — 4/20 is the stoner’s holiday. But it caused more trouble. (Even though he sparked up on Joe Rogan’s podcast, Mr. Musk said he’s not a big pot smoker because it makes you too logy.) Mr. Musk’s mad energy and tendency to dream big and overpromise were reflected in that tweet, which blew up in his face spectacularly. The S.E.C. fined him and his company $20 million apiece, and he had to forfeit his chairman title for three years. The scandal hit warp speed when Azealia Banks, the rapper who relishes tangling with celebrities and who happened to be at Mr. Musk’s house then to work on music with Grimes, posted an unflattering Instagram story about what she described as a meltdown inside his house. Grimes told Rolling Stone that the contretemps was “a sad, dark thing. I just, like, forgive her, and forgiving her is really, really hard.” She recalled that she lost it. “I felt I had caused the downfall of everything I care about and everyone I care about,” she said, adding that Mr. Musk calmed her down by snapping his fingers in front of her face and telling her to snap out of it because “You have to be in a battle right now.” How did Mr. Musk stop the unraveling? He poured himself even more into his work, staying on “the front lines with a sword and shield.” The herculean nature of turning Tesla into a well-oiled machine, he said, has not been “well appreciated.” “The logistics are mind-boggling, trying to deliver 7,000 cars per week in 40 different countries,"" he said. “There were just a bunch of mistakes that we made in creating the production system.” For many of the coastal elites for whom a Tesla is a status symbol, Mr. Musk’s laissez-faire approach to the pandemic was disappointing, and sounded way too Trumpian. In the spring, when his California factory was shut down, he called stay-at-home orders “fascist” and tweeted, “FREE AMERICA NOW.” “I think the reality of Covid is that it is dangerous if you’re elderly and have pre-existing conditions,” he said, adding: “It absolutely makes sense to have a lockdown if you’re vulnerable, but I do not think it makes sense to have a lockdown if you’re not vulnerable.” He said he may have had Covid in January and he wears a mask on the factory floor. The Tesla-loving liberals were horrified again by a May tweet, “Take the red pill,"" an allusion to the pill Keanu Reeves takes in “The Matrix” that lets him see the truth. The red-pill image has become linked with the fringe right and men’s rights activism. It blew up when Ivanka Trump retweeted it and said “Taken!” and when Lilly Wachowski, a creator of “The Matrix,” then cursed out both Mr. Musk and Ms. Trump. (Even Grimes’s mother, a Canadian journalist, tweeted her dissatisfaction.) Mr. Musk said he did not have a political message. “No, it’s just: Accept reality as it is as opposed to what you wish it were.” Of Ivanka, he said, “I think she was interpreting it through more of a political lens than it was intended.” Mr. Musk sat on business advisory councils for President Trump early in his administration but bounced once Mr. Trump ripped up the Paris climate accord. Still, Mr. Trump was there for Mr. Musk’s rocket launch. “We did not talk privately, but he did comment to congratulate the SpaceX team,” he said. The president has called Mr. Musk “one of our great geniuses,” likening him to Thomas Edison. Does he blanch at being clasped in the MAGA embrace? “I’ll take the compliment,"" said Mr. Musk, who has also said that the idea of the Space Force is “cool.” “You know, I’m not sure that everything is so political,” he said. “To be totally frank, you may be interpreting this through a lens where you think everything is totally political because you’re political. But I think the general public does not see everything through a political lens. I would say the amount of thought that the general public puts into politics is quite low. They’re mostly thinking about their day and their direct relationships and their work.” OK, he might have a point. But what does he think about Biden? “I just haven’t had much interaction with Biden,"" he said. “I talked to Obama much more than Biden.” He notes that he was such a fervent Obama supporter that he once waited in line for six hours to shake Obama’s hand when he was running, adding, “the poor guy was so tired at the end of the night.” Mr. Musk continued, “Obama was great. Biden, I just don’t know. It’s hard to see through the noise. But is he — are all his mental faculties there or not? I can’t quite tell. It would be helpful to see him in a debate scenario or something like that. Does he have his stuff together or not? I can’t tell.” Despite the fact that he wants someone in the White House who has his stuff together, he encouraged Kanye West’s bid for the presidency. “I’ve known him for at least 10 years, maybe longer,” he said, noting that while they see each other about once every six months, they text “fairly often.” Mr. West recently tweeted a picture of the pair — both wearing Yeezy sneakers — with Mr. Musk’s Sorayama sculpture of an android woman looking at a one-way mirror. Grimes, who took the picture, is reflected in the frame. “I’ve done my best to convince him that 2024 would be better than 2020,” Mr. Musk said, so that Mr. West wouldn’t be accused of splitting the Black vote with Mr. Biden. After a news conference at a campaign event in South Carolina, in which Mr. West sobbed talking about his children, and in a bizarre Twitter thread in which he contended that his life was like the horror movie “Get Out,” Kim Kardashian put out a statement talking about her husband’s struggles with bipolar disorder. I called Mr. Musk back to see if the two men have talked. He said he reached out to his friend mid-breakdown and they connected on Tuesday. “When he was about a third of the way through the tweet rampage, just to see if he was doing OK, I sent him a text saying, you know, just checking on you, a lot of people are worried, just wondering if you’re OK,"" he said. “And he called me back and he actually seemed fine. He video FaceTimed me and he was in Wyoming with a bunch of friends. He seemed fine on the call. But it sounds like things are, you know, not fine. There seem to be a lot of issues.” Mr. Musk has to go. There’s an earnings call. Tesla’s fortunes are soaring that day and he announces a new Tesla gigafactory in Austin, Texas, promising it will be “an ecological paradise” on the Colorado River with hiking and biking, open to the public. (“Great job!” Mr. Trump tweets. “MADE IN THE USA!” and Mr. Musk lobs back his thanks.) On the call, he can’t resist “banging the A.I. drum” again, as he puts it, flatly stating about those who can’t imagine that a computer could be smarter than a human: “They’re just way dumber than they think they are.” But for now, until A.I. makes its move, things are good in Elonworld. And there are a lot of galaxies out there to conquer. [And now, a warp-drive round of Confirm or Deny. ] Maureen Dowd: Earlier this month, on the day you found out you were richer than Warren Buffett, you sent him the YouTube clip from “There Will Be Blood” of Daniel Day-Lewis saying, “I Drink Your Milkshake.” Elon Musk: I did that?! Deny! Grand Theft Auto Vice City is the best G.T.A. I’ve actually never played any of the G.T.A.s. It seemed funny that somebody could play G.T.A. on a Tesla, while stealing a Tesla. Princess Mononoke is the best Hayao Miyazaki movie. Yes, agreed. “i <U+2764>anime” is your most popular tweet. It’s definitely one of them. I think for a long time the most popular tweet was that I’m going to buy Fortnite and delete it to save these kids from eternal virginity. You got the idea to trademark Teslaquila while binge-watching “Entourage.” Deny. You have a secret Parler account I don’t even know what Parler is. You fear your own fanboys. Deny. You’re still in mourning over Harambe. True. Your favorite fictional character is Samwise Gamgee. Yeah. Gandalf the Grey was cooler than Gandalf the White. Hmm, that’s a tough one. I think in some ways he was cooler, but he kind of needed to defeat the Balrog in order to become a better wizard, I guess, and play a bigger role in defeating Sauron. But he was definitely more chill as Gandalf the Grey and had a better sense of humor. Mars will be gentrified in 20 years and then become really boring and all the cool people will have to move to Jupiter. Yes, gentrification is arguably the most powerful force in the universe. Even Mordor could not resist gentrification. The No. 1 Musk family rule is the one from “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy: “Don’t panic.” The third rule is “Safety third.” And there is no second rule. Yes! This is true. You have a secret Instagram account. I deleted my Instagram. Technically, I have a secret account. It’s only to see links of things that people send me. When you were little, your nickname was “Encyclopedia” because you read the entire Encyclopaedia Britannica and Collier’s Encyclopedia. I had a lot of nicknames. Many of them were not flattering. Usually involving some version of my name, like Muskrat. You have a group text with the three Emanuel brothers. That’s actually true, yeah. Your favorite Roman emperor was Crassus. Oh, no! And he wasn’t an emperor. He was one of the triumvirate. Microdosing can be productive. (Laughs.) I don’t microdose. Short sellers should wear short shorts. Absolutely. You like to relax by watching “Property Brothers” and drinking a glass of rosé. (Bursts out laughing.) Definitely not. I don’t know that show and I prefer red wine over rosé. Warren Buffett is overrated. Hahaha. Um, I think he has managed to create a great image for himself as a kindly grandfather, which is maybe overstating the case. You’re hoping that Donald Trump volunteers for the first neural net. Deny. When Grimes put a piece of her soul up for auction for 10 million, you bought it. I did not, no. At the University of Pennsylvania, you rented a 10-bedroom frat house and turned it into a nightclub. There wasn’t a frat involved. It was just myself and my housemate and a third roommate. We did basically rent big houses and pay for the rent by throwing parties. You had to pay to come to our parties because ours were much better than the frat parties. Mark Zuckerberg is a sociopath. (Laughs.) Ah, oh, man. (Laughs some more.) Ehhh, Mark Zuckerberg has some issues, we all have some issues. My concern with Facebook is that he just has absolute control over Facebook with the way the voting shares are structured. And it’s also structured such that the Zuckerberg dynasty will have control over Facebook and his great-grandkids will control the thing. So I think we ought to be careful of creating dynastic wealth in the U.S. Just generally, an aristocracy of wealth is a cause for concern. It was irritating when Bill Ackman, the hedge fund manager, told CNBC this week that he bought a Tesla and loves it but was going to send you some ideas for improvements. Well, no. Generally when somebody has ordered a Tesla, the first thing I ask them is what can we do to make it better. You’d rather be a meme lord than a billionaire. Probably true. You know, you need resources in order to make life multiplanetary. That’s the reason I’m accumulating resources. But I don’t otherwise care about resources.","king mars galactic princess newborn son æ xii spend saturday night holed los angeles pad anime death note evangelion lots late night debates potential

"Fall Movies 2018: Dive Into an Ocean’s Worth of Offerings","This is a select list of noteworthy films due this fall. Release dates are subject to change. Read more listings for art, dance, classical music, pop music, television and theater. Add events directly to your calendar. GARRY WINOGRAND: ALL THINGS ARE PHOTOGRAPHABLE The photographer (1928-84), who recorded middle-class life in New York City with “a fanatical vigor,” as Holland Cotter once wrote in The New York Times, is remembered in a documentary that argues for his vitality as an artist. ASSASSINATION NATION A teenage-centered, midnight movie update of late-17th-century hysteria: a hacker reveals the secrets of a town called Salem. Odessa Young, the singer Abra and Suki Waterhouse star. CALL HER GANDA PJ Raval’s documentary follows the case of Jennifer Laude, a Filipina transgender woman who was killed in 2014 and whose death became an activist cause. The next year, a Philippine court convicted a United States Marine of homicide. COLETTE Wash Westmoreland, in his first feature since the 2015 death of his husband and filmmaking partner, Richard Glatzer, directs a biographical portrait of the French writer Colette (Keira Knightley) during the period when her early novels were published under the name of her husband (Dominic West). DRAGONFLY EYES After culling footage from the internet, the artist Xu Bing edited material shot on surveillance cameras in China into a fictional narrative. FAHRENHEIT 11/9 With “Fahrenheit 9/11,” Michael Moore won the Palme d’Or at Cannes but failed to unseat President George W. Bush in the 2004 election. With “Fahrenheit 11/9” — a reference to the day after the 2016 vote — he gets in his say on President Trump and much else (the Flint water crisis, the state of the Democratic Party) before the 2018 midterms. A HAPPENING OF MONUMENTAL PROPORTIONS Common, Allison Janney and Jennifer Garner star in the actress Judy Greer’s feature directing debut, a comedy built around a cataclysmically bad day at school. THE HOUSE WITH A CLOCK IN ITS WALLS Experience the enchanting side of Eli Roth (“Hostel”), working for the first time with Steven Spielberg’s Amblin Entertainment. The movie is adapted from John Bellairs’s 1973 book of the same title, which had illustrations by Edward Gorey. Owen Vaccaro plays a boy who moves into an old dark house. Jack Black and Cate Blanchett provide a semblance of adult supervision. LIFE ITSELF When two incredibly good-looking people (Oscar Isaac and Olivia Wilde) get together, their relationship is just the start of a multigenerational, continent-bridging story that audiences have to piece together in a manner similar to “This Is Us.” Dan Fogelman, that show’s creator, wrote and directed. Annette Bening, Mandy Patinkin and Antonio Banderas are involved. LITTLE ITALY Two pizzerias, both alike in dignity, in fair Toronto, where they filmed our scene. From the pies of these two chefs, a pair of star-cross’d lovers, their children (Emma Roberts and Hayden Christensen), take their bites. LOVE, GILDA Friends and admirers of Gilda Radner celebrate her genius on “Saturday Night Live” and elsewhere, with the help of her writings, voice recordings and plenty of clips. QUINCY Rashida Jones and Alan Hicks direct this profile of Quincy Jones, the celebrated jazz musician and music producer (also Rashida’s father). On the basis of the February interview he gave Vulture — he claimed that the mobster Sam Giancana killed John F. Kennedy and that Marlon Brando would have sex with a mailbox — he should make for lively company. THE SISTERS BROTHERS Adapted from Patrick deWitt’s novel (and strikingly shot by Benoît Debie), Jacques Audiard’s offbeat western stars Joaquin Phoenix and John C. Reilly as gunslinging brothers tracking a chemist (Riz Ahmed) who has devised a secret formula that may make him rich as a prospector. Jake Gyllenhaal, roughly the equivalent of Saul Rubinek in “Unforgiven,” moves between their worlds. THE SONG OF SWAY LAKE A music collector (Rory Culkin) ropes a friend into a scheme to find and steal a storied record recorded at his grandparents’ wedding. Family secrets are spilled. TEA WITH THE DAMES Three of the stars of “Tea With Mussolini” — Maggie Smith, Judi Dench and Joan Plowright — and Eileen Atkins sit down to drink tea and reminisce with one another. Roger Michell directed this documentary. ALL ABOUT NINA In a performance that volleys between raw anger and scalpel-sharp humor, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, carrying every scene, plays a comic whose routines are at once a mask and an outlet for her demons. Eva Vives (who shared a story credit on “Raising Victor Vargas”) wrote and directed the film, a highlight of this year’s Tribeca Film Festival. BAD REPUTATION The reputation belongs to the pioneering rock frontwoman Joan Jett, of course, and this documentary is here to burnish it. BLACK 47 During the Great Famine of the mid-19th century, an Irishman (James Frecheville) who fought with the British switches sides and vows vengeance. Hugo Weaving co-stars. FREE SOLO Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin, the married filmmaking team behind the acclaimed mountain-climbing documentary “Meru,” follow the climber Alex Honnold on his quest to surmount El Capitan in Yosemite National Park. Next to the Himalayan peak in “Meru,” that doesn’t sound too hard. But he has no rope. HOLD THE DARK Jeffrey Wright plays an expert who travels to northern Alaska to help a bereaved mother (Riley Keough) track her son’s killers — a pack of wolves. Jeremy Saulnier, whose credits include “Blue Ruin,” directed, working from a screenplay by a star of that film, Macon Blair. MATANGI/MAYA/M.I.A. The “Paper Planes” rapper reflects on her childhood as the daughter of a Tamil activist in Sri Lanka, her adolescence as a refugee in Britain, and how those experiences and others shaped her music. MONSTERS AND MEN Reinaldo Marcus Green’s Brooklyn-centered examination of police brutality moves through three interlinked protagonists: a man (Anthony Ramos) who films the slaying of an unarmed civilian on his phone; an African-American police officer (John David Washington, who played another conflicted officer in “BlacKkKlansman”) who faces profiling himself as well as pressure from within the force; and a high schooler (Kelvin Harrison Jr.) drawn to activism. NIGHT SCHOOL Kevin Hart works to earn his G.E.D., which is no easy feat with Tiffany Haddish as a teacher. The film reunites Ms. Haddish with Malcolm D. Lee, the director of her breakout performance in “Girls Trip.” THE OLD MAN & THE GUN A retiring Robert Redford makes the most of what he says will be his final role as a well-mannered bank robber who enjoys the thrill of stealing more than the spoils. Casey Affleck plays a lawman on his trail; Sissy Spacek offers him a chance at late-life romance. David Lowery (“A Ghost Story”) directed. SMALLFOOT How’s this for a reversal? This animated musical is set among a world of Bigfoots who believe that humans are mythical creatures — that is, until one of the Yetis (Channing Tatum) meets a Smallfoot (James Corden). Gina Rodriguez, Common and LeBron James add their voices to the mix. 306 HOLLYWOOD Mounting a kind of archaeological dig of their dead grandmother’s home, the sibling directors Elan and Jonathan Bogarín use her belongings as inspiration for a disquisition on memory and preserving the past. MOYNIHAN The legacy of Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the four-term senator from New York, is probed in this documentary, which features commentary from across the political spectrum by the likes of Ta-Nehisi Coates and Henry Kissinger. ABOVE AND BEYOND: NASA’S JOURNEY TO TOMORROW The documentarian Rory Kennedy (“Last Days in Vietnam”) directed this historical look at NASA. It’s being released for the space agency’s 60th anniversary. BAYOU CAVIAR Cuba Gooding Jr. directs himself in the role of an ex-boxer roped into a scheme by a Russian gangster (Richard Dreyfuss). THE GREAT BUSTER: A CELEBRATION Peter Bogdanovich directs this tribute to Buster Keaton, the “great stone face” of silent-screen comedy, with testimonials from, among others, Mel Brooks; Keaton’s spiritual heir, Johnny Knoxville; and Werner Herzog, who can explain how the falling rocks in “Seven Chances” represent the “overwhelming indifference of nature.” PRIVATE LIFE Tamara Jenkins (“The Savages”) wrote and directed this film about a couple (Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti) dealing with infertility, which puts a strain on their marriage. Kayli Carter, a relative unknown, earned acclaim at Sundance for her performance as their stepniece. A STAR IS BORN It’s an oldie but a goodie: Bradley Cooper directs what is at least the fifth screen version of this story, after “What Price Hollywood?” from 1932 and three movies with the title “A Star Is Born,” from 1937, 1954 and 1976. Lady Gaga steps into the shoes of Constance Bennett, Janet Gaynor, Judy Garland and Barbra Streisand. Mr. Cooper has the Lowell Sherman/Fredric March/James Mason/Kris Kristofferson role. STUDIO 54 The documentarian Matt Tyrnauer, not done with spicy tales of yesteryear after “Scotty and the Secret History of Hollywood,” remembers the disco-era nightclub in a documentary that struck some festival reviewers as definitive. TROUBLE The playwright Theresa Rebeck writes and directs this story of feuding siblings (Anjelica Huston and Bill Pullman). VENOM A question hovers over “Venom,” Marvel’s latest. And that question is: Will fusion with an alien symbiote make Tom Hardy intelligible? He plays a journalist who becomes a supervillain (albeit one with less villainous tendencies than most). Michelle Williams and Riz Ahmed also star; Ruben Fleischer (“Zombieland”) directed. THE HAPPY PRINCE Rupert Everett, realizing a long-gestating project, writes, directs and stars in this portrait of Oscar Wilde. It finds the “Importance of Being Earnest” scribe, about to die, looking back on the later years of his life. Colin Morgan, Colin Firth and Emily Watson co-star. 22 JULY Paul Greengrass, who previously turned the events of Sept. 11 into a tense procedural in “United 93,” now turns his gaze to the 2011 massacre on the island of Utoya, Norway. Anders Danielsen Lie (“Oslo, August 31st”) stars. It’s the second movie on this topic this year. BAD TIMES AT THE EL ROYALE The guests at a tacky hotel that straddles the California-Nevada state line run into some trouble. Given that the director is Drew Goddard (“The Cabin in the Woods”), expect surprises. The cast includes Jeff Bridges, Dakota Johnson, Jon Hamm and the stage star Cynthia Erivo. BARBARA Jeanne Balibar plays the French singer-songwriter Barbara in a self-reflexive biopic that challenges the conventions of the form. The actor Mathieu Amalric directed. BEAUTIFUL BOY Timothée Chalamet (“Call Me by Your Name”) has Oscar prognosticators excited about his performance as Nic Sheff, whose father, David Sheff (Steve Carell), wrote a best-selling book about witnessing Nic’s experiences with drug addiction. (The movie draws on multiple tomes by the father and son.) Amy Ryan plays David’s ex-wife. Felix Van Groeningen directed. CLASSICAL PERIOD The experimental filmmaker Ted Fendt directs this portrait of ultra-dedicated translators of Dante. FIRST MAN We’ve already gotten modern classics about the Mercury astronauts (“The Right Stuff”) and the troubled Apollo 13 mission (“Apollo 13”). It seems like it would just be one small step to make a movie about Neil Armstrong, but somehow Hollywood has overlooked him until now. Damien Chazelle, who won a directing Oscar for “La La Land” (2016), reunites with Ryan Gosling (playing Armstrong) to rectify that. They’re working from the historian James R. Hansen’s authorized biography, which drew on extensive interviews with Armstrong. Also starring Claire Foy as Janet Armstrong and Corey Stoll as Buzz Aldrin. GOOSEBUMPS 2: HAUNTED HALLOWEEN R.L. Stine’s apparently inexhaustible series of children’s horror books previously served as the basis of a movie in 2015. Now here’s the sequel, with a cast that includes Wendi McLendon-Covey (“The Goldbergs”) and Ken Jeong (“Crazy Rich Asians”). THE KINDERGARTEN TEACHER Maggie Gyllenhaal earned raves at Sundance for her performance in Sara Colangelo’s remake of Nadav Lapid’s excellent Israeli film, about a kindergarten teacher who becomes obsessed with tapping the genius of one of her students (Parker Sevak), an apparent poetry prodigy. THE OATH When the executive branch mandates that Americans sign a loyalty oath by the day after Thanksgiving, it makes for an awkward holiday for a couple who aren’t on board (Ike Barinholtz, who wrote and directed, and Tiffany Haddish) but spend turkey day with relatives. Featuring Nora Dunn, Carrie Brownstein and John Cho. OVER THE LIMIT With a mat-side seat, this documentary watches as the Russian gymnast Margarita Mamun prepares for the 2016 Olympics. THE SENTENCE The director Rudy Valdez takes a personal angle on the subject of mandatory-minimum sentencing: His sister was convicted of conspiracy charges related to her former boyfriend and sentenced to 15 years. Mr. Valdez filmed her daughters and the rest of their family during her time away. CHARM CITY The director Marilyn Ness spent three years examining violence in Baltimore from the perspective of community advocates, police and politicians, in a documentary that sounds like a nonfiction version of “The Wire.” CAN YOU EVER FORGIVE ME? Melissa McCarthy stars in a character study of Lee Israel (1939-2014), a biographer of Tallulah Bankhead and Estée Lauder who fell on hard times and in the early 1990s forged and sold letters from literary icons. In the movie, Richard E. Grant plays her down-and-out friend and partner in scamming. Marielle Heller (“The Diary of a Teenage Girl”) directed. GALVESTON Mélanie Laurent directed — and adapted, from a novel by the “True Detective” creator Nic Pizzolatto — this thriller, which finds a hit man (Ben Foster) on the run with the kidnapping victim (Elle Fanning) he rescued. THE GUILTY A Danish police dispatcher fielding emergency calls (Jakob Cedergren) overhears evidence that a woman has been kidnapped and spends a frantic evening trying rescue her. Gustav Möller’s suspense movie, shown at Sundance and New Directors/New Films, confines itself to the dispatcher’s perspective, never leaving the call center. HALLOWEEN For those keeping score, this is the third movie to take the title “Halloween,” following Rob Zombie’s 2007 version, which got a sequel in 2009. The new one is less a remake than a reboot-continuation, piggybacking off the events of John Carpenter’s 1978 movie. Jamie Lee Curtis returns as Laurie Strode, who has been killed off multiple times, including at the beginning of “Halloween: Resurrection” (2002), which itself was the eighth movie in the original series. David Gordon Green directed, continuing to taunt critics who praised him when he was a promising indie upstart (“George Washington”). THE HATE U GIVE In this adaptation of the best-selling YA novel by Angie Thomas (which grew out of a short story inspired by the conversation surrounding the death of Oscar Grant III), Amandla Stenberg plays a code-switching teenager with one face for her neighborhood and one for her prep school — until her friend is shot by a police officer. Russell Hornsby, Regina Hall and Common also star. George Tillman Jr. directed. MID90S Jonah Hill makes his first feature as a director, and it’s a period coming-of-age story about a 13-year-old in Los Angeles (Sunny Suljic) who falls in with a crowd of skateboarders. NIGERIAN PRINCE Sent against his will to live with his aunt in Nigeria, an American teenager (Antonio J. Bell) starts working with his con-artist cousin (Chinaza Uche). The film was a highlight of this year’s Tribeca Film Festival and a promising feature debut from Faraday Okoro. ON HER SHOULDERS Alexandria Bombach directs this portrait of Nadia Murad, a Yazidi woman who, after surviving abduction by fighters for the Islamic State, became a human-rights activist. THE PRICE OF EVERYTHING Having already investigated his largely absent father, the architect Louis Kahn, in “My Architect,” Nathaniel Kahn looks at how contemporary art is priced and sold, from the perspectives of artists, auctioneers, collectors and others. SERENITY The captain of a fishing boat (Matthew McConaughey) is approached by his ex-wife (Anne Hathaway, in femme fatale blond hair), who wants him to feed her current husband (Jason Clarke) to the sharks. Djimon Hounsou and Diane Lane also star. Steven Knight (“Locke”) wrote and directed. TRANSFORMER — STRENGTH BEYOND MUSCLE This documentary follows the story of a male body builder and cancer survivor in the process of transitioning to female. TVTV: VIDEO REVOLUTIONARIES A documentary tells the story of a collective of video journalists who were early adopters of Sony’s Portapak, a portable camera that could be used to catch famous subjects on the fly — long before they learned to expect that could happen. THE WALDHEIM WALTZ Ruth Beckermann looks back at the exposure of the former United Nations Secretary General Kurt Waldheim’s Nazi ties at the time he sought the Austrian presidency in 1986 — revelations that, in Austria, were met with an anti-Semitic backlash. WHAT THEY HAD Blythe Danner plays a matriarch with Alzheimer’s; Robert Forster is the patriarch; and Hilary Swank and Michael Shannon play their children. Elizabeth Chomko wrote and directed. WILDLIFE When his father (Jake Gyllenhaal) goes off to fight a forest fire, Joe (Ed Oxenbould) gains a dawning awareness of the loneliness and desperation of his mother (Carey Mulligan). Zoe Kazan and Paul Dano wrote the confidently understated script, adapting a novel by Richard Ford, and Mr. Dano makes his feature directing debut. LIFE AND NOTHING MORE The director Antonio Méndez Esparza brings a documentarylike immediacy to this indie, a festival favorite about a mother (Regina Williams) on her own with her son (Andrew Bleechington). AIR STRIKE Bruce Willis and Adrien Brody headline this action film set during World War II and focusing on the Chinese military response to Japanese bomber strikes. Xiao Feng directed. A BREAD FACTORY Patrick Wang, whose self-distributed debut feature, “In the Family,” appeared as an out-of-nowhere wonder in 2011, directs what sounds like a crazily ambitious project — actually two films, each two hours, that’s said to be part drama, part comedy and part musical. The bread factory of the title is an arts space whose financing comes under threat. With an expansive scope, the film depicts the reaction of the town. (An earlier feature from Mr. Wang, “The Grief of Others,” opens the next week.) BURNING At Cannes, one of the metrics of buzz is Screen International magazine’s “jury grid,” with critics contributing daily ratings. The South Korean director Lee Chang-dong’s film broke the record for the highest score in the grid’s yearslong history. His ecstatically reviewed adaptation of a Haruki Murakami story concerns an aimless young man (Yoo Ah-in); the mysterious young woman (Jun Jong-seo) with whom becomes involved; and the wealth-flaunting charmer (Steven Yeun) who comes between them. HUNTER KILLER It was probably only a matter of time until Gerard Butler played a submarine captain. In this case, it’s an American sub whose crew endeavors to rescue the Russian president from a kidnapping plot. Gary Oldman, Common and Linda Cardellini are involved. JOHNNY ENGLISH STRIKES AGAIN Summoning his inner Inspector Clouseau, Rowan Atkinson returns as the bumbling secret agent Johnny English (a.k.a. the character of his who’s not Mr. Bean). Olga Kurylenko and Emma Thompson are embroiled in the antics. MONROVIA, INDIANA Some of Frederick Wiseman’s greatest films (“Aspen,” “In Jackson Heights”) are portraits of towns or neighborhoods, and this look at a farming community about a half-hour from Indianapolis is sure to brim with complexity and challenge prejudices. 1985 Over the holidays, a young man sweats over coming out to his family, which is conservative and, he presumes, won’t react well to the news. Yen Tan directed. Cory Michael Smith, Virginia Madsen and Michael Chiklis star. SHIRKERS Sandi Tan revisits the footage from an unfinished movie she filmed with friends in Singapore in the early 1990s. It was never completed, for reasons this essay film — an absorbing and original mix of reminiscence, reflection and investigative mystery — gradually parcels out. SOLIS An astronaut (Steven Ogg) is alone aboard an escape pod that’s drifting toward the sun, with only a radio contact (Alice Lowe) to guide him. SUSPIRIA The ingénue is Dakota Johnson rather than Jessica Harper; the score is by the Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke instead of Goblin; and the visual stylishness comes courtesy of the director Luca Guadagnino (“Call Me by Your Name”). We’ll see if they can cast a spell for 152 minutes — the running time of this remake of Dario Argento’s 1977 Italian giallo classic. THREE PEAKS Mom’s boyfriend (Alexander Fehling) really wants to get along with her son (Arian Montgomery). The child, however, has other plans, and hopes that his mother (Bérénice Bejo) will reunite with his dad. Then, on a mountain vacation, the boy goes missing. VIPER CLUB Susan Sarandon plays a mother weighing her options when her son, a journalist, is held hostage by terrorists. Maryam Keshavarz (“Circumstance”) directed. BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY Rami Malek is Freddie Mercury, the lead singer of Queen, in a biopic that tells the band’s story. The director Bryan Singer’s name is still on it, but his unexplained absence during filming got him fired from the project. Will moviegoers do the Fandango and buy tickets anyway? BOY ERASED Lucas Hedges plays the gay son of a pastor. Facing ostracism from his parents (Nicole Kidman and Russell Crowe), the teenager attends a “conversion therapy” program. Joel Edgerton directed, from the memoir by Garrard Conley. MARIA BY CALLAS Already a popular biopic subject onstage (Terrence McNally’s “Master Class”), the opera singer Maria Callas (1923-77) here tells her own story in a way, through interview clips, writings and other artifacts from her life. NOBODY’S FOOL Tyler Perry’s second feature this year deals with two sisters — one just out of jail (Tiffany Haddish), the other a rising star in a company (Tika Sumpter). Whoopi Goldberg and Omari Hardwick also star. THE NUTCRACKER AND THE FOUR REALMS Lasse Hallström and Joe Johnston direct this live-action take on Tchaikovsky’s ballet; the results appear to add a helping of “Alice in Wonderland,” with Mackenzie Foy as a girl who stumbles into a magical world. Jayden Fowora-Knight, Keira Knightley, Helen Mirren and Morgan Freeman also star. THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WIND In the most exciting posthumous release since Stanley Kubrick’s “Eyes Wide Shut,” this unfinished project from Orson Welles — who cut a roughly 45-minute work print — will finally be seen in a completed form after decades of rights disputes and efforts to bring all the footage together under one roof. Welles’s collaborators Frank Marshall and Peter Bogdanovich were involved in the final edit, which paid attention to the notes the great director left behind. THEY’LL LOVE ME WHEN I’M DEAD Morgan Neville (“Won’t You Be My Neighbor”) directs this look at the final years of Orson Welles’s career, including his efforts to complete “The Other Side of the Wind,” which will be released the same day as Mr. Neville’s documentary. A PRIVATE WAR The documentarian Matthew Heineman (“Cartel Land”) turns to dramatic features with this biopic of the war correspondent Marie Colvin (Rosamund Pike), who was killed in Syria in 2012. Jamie Dornan co-stars. SEARCHING FOR INGMAR BERGMAN Margarethe von Trotta directed this extensive look at the career of Ingmar Bergman, whose centennial has been widely celebrated this year. THE FRONT RUNNER Just in time for the day after the midterm elections, Hugh Jackman plays the Democratic presidential candidate Gary Hart in Jason Reitman’s film about the end of his 1988 candidacy in the wake of reports suggesting that he had an affair with Donna Rice (Sara Paxton). Vera Farmiga and J.K. Simmons co-star. The journalist and former New York Times Magazine writer Matt Bai is one of the screenwriters, adapting his own book. CHEF FLYNN Cameron Yates directs this portrait of Flynn McGarry, who became a celebrity chef as a teenager. DR. SEUSS’ THE GRINCH Dr. Seuss’ curmudgeon
Who tries Christmas to snatch
Returns in cartoon form
Voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch. EL ANGEL In a splashy style perhaps influenced by one of its producers, Pedro Almodóvar, the director Luis Ortega recounts the crime spree of the serial killer Carlos Robledo Puch (Lorenzo Ferro), who has been called Argentina’s longest-serving prisoner. THE GIRL IN THE SPIDER’S WEB A long way from Buckingham Palace, Claire Foy (“The Crown”) takes over for Rooney Mara and Noomi Rapace as the leather-clad, tatted avenger Lisbeth Salander, in the first film adapted from a book by David Lagercrantz, who continued the series begun by Stieg Larsson. Sverrir Gudnason, Lakeith Stanfield, Vicky Krieps (“Phantom Thread”) and Claes Bang (“The Square”) also star. Fede Alvarez (“Don’t Breathe”) directed. HERE AND NOW In a film with structural similarities to Agnès Varda’s “Cléo From 5 to 7,” Sarah Jessica Parker plays a singer who is trailed over the 24 hours after she receives a dire diagnosis. Common is in this as well. THE LONG DUMB ROAD Tony Revolori (the trainee bellhop in “The Grand Budapest Hotel”) stars as a 19-year-old who’s bound for California on a road trip and gains a friend and traveling companion (Jason Mantzoukas) when his car breaks down. Hannah Fidell directed. THE NEW ROMANTIC Jessica Barden plays a college senior who begins dating a sugar daddy as research for the school paper. OUTLAW KING A long way from the Texas of “Hell or High Water,” the director David Mackenzie returns to Scotland for an epic about Robert the Bruce, an outlaw who became the king of Scotland (and was previously seen in “Braveheart”). Chris Pine stars. OVERLORD Jovan Adepo plays an American soldier who, as D-Day nears, is dropped into occupied France. He encounters creatures engineered in a Nazi lab. J.J. Abrams is one of the producers. PETERLOO Returning to the 19th century (after “Mr. Turner”), Mike Leigh directs a dramatization of the Peterloo massacre in 1819, when workers demanding more rights and voting reforms met with violence from British government forces. Rory Kinnear and Maxine Peake star. POSTCARDS FROM LONDON After more than 20 years away, the New Queer Cinema director Steve McLean (“Postcards From America”) returns to moviemaking with this film starring Harris Dickinson (“Beach Rats”) as a young man who falls in with a group of London escorts. SHOAH: FOUR SISTERS Claude Lanzmann, who died in July, carved four short movies out of interviews he shot for the making of his monumental “Shoah” (1985). Each focuses on testimony from a different female Holocaust survivor. In the longest, the harrowing “The Hippocratic Oath,” Ruth Elias, a Czechoslovakian Jew, remembers being pregnant at Auschwitz and having Josef Mengele as her physician. ANCHOR AND HOPE The director Carlos Marques-Marcet reunites with Natalia Tena, who starred in his festival favorite “10.000 km” and here plays a London woman who is goaded by her partner (Oona Chaplin) into starting what morphs into a kind of three-headed family with a friend. AT ETERNITY’S GATE Vincent Van Gogh has previously been portrayed in movies by Kirk Douglas (“Lust for Life”) and Martin Scorsese (“Akira Kurosawa’s Dreams”), among others. Now the fearless Willem Dafoe gets a chance to go earless as the painter in his last days, in a biopic directed by Julian Schnabel, who promises to bring an artist’s eye to Van Gogh’s creative process. Oscar Isaac plays Paul Gauguin. THE BALLAD OF BUSTER SCRUGGS Reports say that the Coen brothers’ anthology western started as a Netflix series and became a multipart movie. Hey, if the Coens are going west again (“No Country for Old Men,” “True Grit”), they can do what they want. The cast includes Tim Blake Nelson, Liam Neeson, Zoe Kazan and Tom Waits. THE CLOVEHITCH KILLER In a Hitchcockian premise (specifically, what sounds like a spin on his “Suspicion”), a teenager (Charlie Plummer) starts to suspect his father, a scout leader, could be a serial killer. FANTASTIC BEASTS: THE CRIMES OF GRINDELWALD In the continuing expansion of J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter-verse, the dastardly Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) has escaped capture, and Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) signs on to help catch him at the behest of a young Dumbledore (Jude Law, joining the series). 55 STEPS Bille August directed this story about a hospitalized psychiatric patient (Helena Bonham Carter) who agrees to let a patients’ rights lawyer (Hilary Swank) represent her. GIRL The Belgian director Lukas Dhont won wide acclaim and the Camera d’Or prize (for best first film) at Cannes for this story of a teenager (Victor Polster) who was born male but identifies as a girl and strives to make it as a dancer in the physically demanding discipline of ballet. INSTANT FAMILY Mark Wahlberg and Rose Byrne play a couple who adopt three foster siblings simultaneously, in a dramedy that draws on the experiences of Sean Anders, the director. Isabela Moner, Octavia Spencer, Tig Notaro and Margo Martindale also star. THE LAST RACE Warmly received at Sundance, Michael Dweck’s documentary looks at the operations and culture of Riverhead Raceway, the last stock-car racing site on Long Island, as the couple who own it contemplate its future. OF FATHERS AND SONS A prizewinner at Sundance, the director Talal Derki’s documentary follows two boys and their family, a radical jihadist household. WIDOWS It’s always interesting when experimentalists like Steve McQueen go mainstream — even before directing “Hunger,” “Shame” and the best picture-winning “12 Years a Slave,” he was a celebrated, uncompromising visual artist. Here he collaborates with the “Sharp Objects” author Gillian Flynn on a Chicago-set genre film. Viola Davis is the ringleader of women who follow through on a crime planned by men who were killed. Michelle Rodriguez, Elizabeth Debicki and Cynthia Erivo also star. THE WORLD BEFORE YOUR FEET Over six years, Matt Green is said to have walked every block of New York City. His story is told in this documentary. CREED II “Rocky” got its sequels, and so now does “Creed.” Michael B. Jordan returns as Adonis Creed (son of Carl Weathers’s Apollo) and Sylvester Stallone, now 72, returns as the Italian Stallion, Adonis’s mentor. Tessa Thompson is also back. Steven Caple Jr. takes over directing duties from Ryan Coogler (“Black Panther”). GREEN BOOK It may seem odd that Peter Farrelly (who with Bobby Farrelly, his brother, is responsible for “There’s Something About Mary” and other sweet-gross comedies) would be making his solo directing debut with a civil rights-era drama, about the friendship between the African-American jazz pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) and his white driver (Viggo Mortensen) during a tour of the Deep South. Then again, the Farrellys’ movies — from “Dumb and Dumber” to “Stuck on You” — have often focused on friends or siblings who lean on each other. RALPH BREAKS THE INTERNET Only a bad take or a good meme can break the internet. But Ralph (John C. Reilly) and Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) try in a sequel that finds them mixing it up with new characters from across the web. Gal Gadot, Jack McBrayer and Taraji P. Henson also lend their voices. ROBIN HOOD You think it’s too soon to reboot Robin Hood, seen on screen, in the form of Russell Crowe, as recently as 2010? Nonsense: Hollywood should keep robbing from its backers and giving to poor moviegoers until it gets this legend right. Taron Egerton stars as Robin of Loxley, which, to paraphrase Mel Brooks, presumably means that Eve Hewson is playing Marian of Bagel. Jamie Foxx plays Little John. THE SANDINISTAS Jenny Murray’s documentary specifically focuses on the women who fought with the Sandinistas in Nicaragua and their advocacy for reform. SECOND ACT Jennifer Lopez plays a woman who is hired for a high-powered Madison Avenue job after someone gives her online identity a makeover — with significant embellishments. Leah Remini, Vanessa Hudgens and Milo Ventimiglia co-star in this comedy. BECOMING ASTRID Astrid is Astrid Lindgren, the creator of Pippi Longstocking, in this biopic starring Alba August as the author in her late teens and early 20s, though played later in life by Maria Fahl Vikander, mother of the Oscar-winning Alicia Vikander. THE FAVOURITE Yorgos Lanthimos (“The Lobster”) brings his absurdist wit to an 18th-century period piece — a dark comedy about the two women (Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone) who compete for the favor of Queen Anne (Olivia Colman). It opens the New York Film Festival on Sept. 28. SHOPLIFTERS Hirokazu Kore-eda’s poignant drama, which won the Palme d’Or at Cannes in May, is best seen with as little foreknowledge as possible. It concerns a family of petty thieves who take in a young girl. ANNA AND THE APOCALYPSE If teenage romance and an evil headmaster weren’t trouble enough, high schoolers suddenly find themselves besieged by zombies over the Christmas season. Oh, and it’s a musical — by turns fun and sad. The project was the brainchild of the Scottish filmmaker Ryan McHenry, who died at 27 of bone cancer. His friends and collaborators worked to bring it to fruition. HAPPY AS LAZZARO Alice Rohrwacher won a screenplay prize at Cannes for a movie that freely mixes modes. It’s said to be inspired by a real-life Italian incident in which an isolated estate continued the outlawed practice of sharecropping. Through her protagonist (Adriano Tardiolo), Ms. Rohrwacher blends in elements of the story of Lazarus. IF BEALE STREET COULD TALK Two years after his best-picture-winning “Moonlight,” Barry Jenkins is back with this adaptation of James Baldwin’s 1974 novel, focused on a young couple in Harlem, Tish (KiKi Layne) and Fonny (Stephan James), and what happens when Fonny is wrongfully accused of a rape. In Mr. Baldwin’s telling — and Mr. Jenkins’s — it’s a character-driven piece, about race, love and coping. MIRAI A boy jealous of his infant sister meets her as a time-traveling teenager in this anime feature from Mamoru Hosoda. TYREL At Sundance, Sebastián Silva’s movie drew comparisons to “Get Out.” Jason Mitchell plays a man who travels to upstate New York for a birthday party — and discovers that he’ll be the only African-American there for the whole weekend. ANGEL FACE Marion Cotillard plays a wayward mother who impulsively leaves her 8-year-old daughter. Vanessa Filho directed. BEN IS BACK Peter Hedges, who already tackled Thanksgiving in “Pieces of April,” directs his son Lucas Hedges in the role of a 19-year-old drug addict who comes home for Christmas. His mother (Julia Roberts) fears he won’t restrain himself for long. THE INVISIBLES Claus Räfle’s film focuses on four Jews who survived the Holocaust hiding in Berlin, the capital of the Nazi regime. MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS Saoirse Ronan is Mary Stuart, who as queen of Scotland laid claim to the English throne, occupied by Elizabeth I (Margot Robbie). No spoilers on which one was ultimately beheaded. The screenplay is by Beau Willimon, who knows a thing or two about these sorts of machinations from “House of Cards.” Josie Rourke directed. UNDER THE SILVER LAKE Andrew Garfield stumbles into an incredibly labyrinthine shaggy-dog mystery in Los Angeles when he goes searching for a mysterious woman (Riley Keough) with whom he spent an evening. David Robert Mitchell (“It Follows”) wrote and directed, self-consciously flaunting his influences (“The Long Goodbye,” “The Big Lebowski,” “Inherent Vice,” etc.). CAPERNAUM In Nadine Labaki’s drama, which won a prize at Cannes, a 12-year-old is suing his parents in court in Lebanon. Through flashbacks to his childhood in the direst poverty, we find out why. DEAD SOULS Wang Bing (“’Til Madness Do Us Part”) is known for making arduous but rewarding documentaries. “Dead Souls” — which runs more than eight hours — has already garnered comparisons to “Shoah.” The film presents the testimonies of a group of survivors of Chinese re-education camps, sent there in a 1957 purge by the Communist Party. MORTAL ENGINES Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens — the screenwriting team of “Lord of the Rings” — go seriously “Mad Max” with this adaptation of the first book in a series by Philip Reeve, which takes places in a dystopian world where major cities have wheels and pick on smaller cities. Basically, Earth has become “Monster Trucks.” Christian Rivers, a longtime storyboard and effects artist for Mr. Jackson, directed. ROMA Alfonso Cuarón’s first Mexican feature since “Y Tu Mamá También” takes its title from a neighborhood in Mexico City. This semi-autobiographical tale revolves around the housekeeper (Yalitza Aparicio) for a middle-class family. Early reviews on the festival circuit have been ecstatic. SPIDER-MAN: INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE This umpteenth Spider-Man reboot actually tries something different: It’s animated, from a script by Phil Lord (who directed “The Lego Movie” with Christopher Miller), and it has a new angle: A teenager, Miles Morales (voiced by Shameik Moore), becomes a trainee Spider-Man under the tutelage of Peter Parker (Jake Johnson) This installment adds some diversity to the series — Morales is black and Latino — and there are multiple Spider-Persons, including Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld). UNTITLED ADAM MCKAY DICK CHENEY PROJECT Christian Bale has gotten publicity in the past for messing with his weight for roles, but few probably believed he could play Dick Cheney — until the stills surfaced. There are other unlikely casting choices in the “Big Short” director Adam McKay’s sure-to-be-irreverent take on George W. Bush’s vice president: Amy Adams as Lynne Cheney. Steve Carell as Donald Rumsfeld. Tyler Perry as Colin Powell. SPRINGSTEEN ON BROADWAY On the day of its final Broadway performance, Bruce Springsteen’s hit theater show will be released in a filmed version in cinemas and on Netflix. MARY POPPINS RETURNS First Christopher Robin grew up. Now the children from “Mary Poppins” need revisiting from their old nanny, who has magically transformed into Emily Blunt. Lin Manuel-Miranda, playing a lamplighter, could probably sing a killer “Chim Chim Cher-ee.” Dick Van Dyke appears as well. Rob Marshall, whose track record with screen musicals includes “Chicago” and “Nine,” directed. ALITA: BATTLE ANGEL James Cameron was mentioned in connection with a movie version of “Battle Angel Alita,” a manga series by Yukito Kishiro, since at least sometime shortly after “Titanic.” It’s finally here, with Mr. Cameron as a producer and Robert Rodriguez directing. Rosa Salazar stars as a sympathetic cyborg. With Lana Condor, Christoph Waltz, Jennifer Connelly and Mahershala Ali. AQUAMAN The DC Comics movie universe doubles back from “Justice League” to give Aquaman — half-human, half-scion of Atlantis — a movie of his own. Jason Momoa definitely has a bit of that Poseidon look going. With Amber Heard. James Wan directed. BIRD BOX Based on the book by Josh Malerman, Susanne Bier’s film stars Sandra Bullock as a mother who must lead her children to safety — without being able to see. Trevante Rhodes, Sarah Paulson and John Malkovich also star. BUMBLEBEE Has the “Transformers” series finally turned its attention to human characters? This spinoff involves a teenager (Hailee Steinfeld) who finds out that her beat-up VW bug transforms into the robot Bumblebee. Travis Knight (“Kubo and the Two Strings”) directed. COLD WAR Shooting, as he did in “Ida,” in black-and-white, the Polish director Pawel Pawlikowski tells the story of the love between a singer (Joanna Kulig) and a pianist (Tomasz Kot), as they are separated and reunited (both by choice and by circumstance) during the early part of the Cold War. HOLMES & WATSON Nope, it’s not another entry in the Robert Downey Jr. series. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are played by Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly, and any parody is intentional. The fusty ambience of 221B Baker Street probably isn’t the right backdrop for a reprise of the Catalina wine mixer from “Step Brothers,” but I expect this to be one of the few screen takes on Arthur Conan Doyle to acknowledge Holmes’s habit of mainlining cocaine. Etan Cohen directed. WELCOME TO MARWEN Dramatizing the story told in the documentary “Marwencol” (2010), Robert Zemeckis taps Steve Carell to play the outsider artist Mark Hogancamp, who, having suffered brain damage in an assault, began making a model of a fictional World War II-era town and cast himself as a war hero. The first trailer raised eyebrows for not offering any hint of Mr. Hogancamp’s cross-dressing. Mr. Zemeckis, responding to the controversy in The Telegraph, said, “We can’t give everything away.” Leslie Mann and Janelle Monáe co-star. DESTROYER Nicole Kidman puts in an uncharacteristically dark turn as a Southern California detective who returns to investigating the gang she went undercover to infiltrate years earlier. It’s as much a character study as it is a crime movie. Sebastian Stan and Tatiana Maslany also star. Karyn Kusama directed. ON THE BASIS OF SEX Felicity Jones plays Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in her years as a lawyer fighting gender discrimination, a battle chronicled earlier this year in the hit documentary “RBG.” Armie Hammer plays her husband, Marty Ginsburg. Mimi Leder directed. The screenplay is by the justice’s nephew Daniel Stiepleman. THE HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT Seven years after being declared persona non grata at Cannes, Lars von Trier returned to the festival this year to poke the organizers in the eye. Clearly designed to provoke outrage, the film stars Matt Dillon as a serial killer. His murder spree is presented as a sort of allegory for Mr. von Trier’s body of work, movies that detractors say revel in cruelty toward women (“Dancer in the Dark,” “Dogville”). Uma Thurman and Riley Keough play two of the victims.","select list noteworthy films due fall release dates subject change read listings art dance classical music pop music television theater add

"Far From Campus, a Different Kind of Violence Against Women","On the night of June 6, Michelle Marks, who was 23 years old and lived in the Albany Houses in Crown Heights, was leaving her job at Fornino, a pizzeria a few miles away in Brooklyn Bridge Park, when she was shot in the head and killed. The day before she died, Ms. Marks had filed a report with the police alleging that her former boyfriend, a man with a criminal record who was three decades her senior, had assaulted her at the Albany Houses, trying to grab her groceries. This was the third domestic incident report involving the couple within the course of a few weeks. On May 16, the police said, Ms. Marks had called 911 after she opened the door to her apartment to find the man, Lamont Wright, lurking in the hallway outside. Shortly after the shooting, Mr. Wright was taken into police custody and charged with assaulting and stalking Ms. Marks on the day before the killing. Mr. Wright has not been charged in the shooting, but Capt. Sergio Centa, the commanding officer of the 84th Precinct, which includes Brooklyn Bridge Park, sent an email to community leaders in the wealthy neighborhood telling them about the case, one he said the police believed had resulted from a continuing domestic dispute. There was no reason to think, he continued, that what had happened “was related to any of the issues we have had in the park this year such as overcrowding and/or unruly crowds.” The vexing tone of reassurance reaffirmed the conventional notion that although random violence warrants our apprehension, the presumption that it was a violent former consort who killed a young woman should permit us to abandon our anxieties. The park remained safe for the walking of cockapoos and consumption of rosé. Over the past several years, the issue of campus sexual assault has managed to sustain American attention in a way that few issues regarding the welfare of women, or the welfare of anything, have managed. This was made clear again last week in the outpouring of rage over the lenient sentencing of Brock Turner, a Stanford student convicted of sexual assault. There were calls for the judge, Aaron Persky of Santa Clara County Superior Court, to be removed from the bench, and an old friend of Mr. Turner’s who had written a letter to the courts in his support found that her band was suddenly the object of a boycott in Brooklyn. The statistic that one in five women will be sexually assaulted is surpassed by the figure that one in four women will experience domestic violence in the course of her lifetime, according to data supplied by Safe Horizon, a victims services group. Yet there remains a distinct disparity in our collective interest. Sexual assault has come up during the presidential debates (and during the last Oscars ceremony); domestic violence did not. “There are these moments around incidents like Ray Rice,” Liz Roberts, the deputy chairwoman of Safe Horizon, said, referring to the former N.F.L. running back who was videotaped punching his fiancée, “and then there is a fading away.” Part of the problem lies with rhetoric. Since feminists enlightened the world about the horrors of spousal abuse in the early 1970s and sought to combat it, we have culturally relied on the meme that domestic violence “can happen to anyone.” Commentators invoked the line most recently when Amber Heard, the estranged wife of Johnny Depp, accused him of hitting her. But the sentiment has a long history, popularized beginning in the 1980s and ’90s with a spate of genre movies that fictionalized true stories of women imperiled by their husbands. The women were factory workers, secretaries, bankers’ wives and Washington wives. The truth is that you are far more likely to become a victim of domestic violence if you live in Central Brooklyn than if you live on the Upper East Side or in Georgetown. According to city data, domestic homicides are 65 percent more likely to occur in neighborhoods with high rates of poverty. Since 2002, more than a third of all domestic homicides have occurred in just 15 police precincts that make up only 19 percent of the population. Among tenants of New York City’s Housing Authority, domestic violence incident reports rose from 809 in 2009 to more than twice that figure three years later. Those who commandeer the cultural conversation online are more apt to know someone who has experienced a traumatic sexual encounter in a dorm room than someone who has been beaten or shot by a disgruntled former boyfriend who did not graduate from high school. How might that change? The war against campus sexual assault has taken shape as a war against male entitlement; a dismissive legal and judicial apparatus; an insidious culture of binge drinking. What would a war against domestic violence look like? To some extent it would look like a war on poverty. A war against the bouts of social narcissism that afflict the upper classes. I posed the question to Lisa Smith, the former chief sex crimes prosecutor for the Brooklyn district attorney’s office. “I would like to see a national fatality review team of experienced domestic violence advocates,” she said, “whose job it is to look at these cases, talk to the families and all of the relevant parties and report back not to government entities but to us.” By which she meant ordinary people who might intervene before something terrible happened. “We’re not as good at identifying potential killers as we think.”","night june michelle marks lived albany houses crown heights leaving job fornino pizzeria miles brooklyn bridge park shot head killed day died ms marks filed report police alleging boyfriend criminal record decades senior assaulted albany houses grab groceries domestic incident report involving couple weeks police ms marks called door apartment lamont wright lurking hallway shortly shooting wright police custody charged assaulting stalking ms marks day killing wright charged shooting capt sergio centa commanding officer th precinct includes brooklyn bridge park email community leaders wealthy neighborhood telling police believed resulted continuing domestic dispute reason continued happened related issues park overcrowding unruly crowds vexing tone reassurance reaffirmed conventional notion random violence warrants apprehension presumption violent consort killed woman permit abandon anxieties park remained safe walking cockapoos consumption rosé past issue campus sexual assault managed sustain american attention issues welfare women welfare managed week outpouring rage lenient sentencing brock turner stanford student convicted sexual assault calls judge aaron persky santa clara county superior court removed bench friend turner written letter courts support found band suddenly object boycott brooklyn statistic women sexually assaulted surpassed figure women experience domestic violence lifetime data supplied safe horizon victims services remains distinct disparity collective sexual assault presidential debates oscars ceremony domestic violence moments incidents ray rice liz roberts deputy chairwoman safe horizon referring running videotaped punching fiancée fading lies rhetoric feminists enlightened world horrors spousal abuse s sought combat culturally relied meme domestic violence happen commentators invoked line recently amber heard estranged wife johnny depp accused hitting sentiment history popularized beginning s s spate genre movies fictionalized true stories women imperiled husbands women factory workers secretaries bankers wives washington wives truth victim domestic violence live central brooklyn live upper east georgetown city data domestic homicides percent occur neighborhoods rates poverty domestic homicides occurred police precincts percent population tenants york city housing authority domestic violence incident reports rose figure commandeer cultural conversation online apt experienced traumatic sexual encounter dorm beaten shot disgruntled boyfriend graduate school change war campus sexual assault shape war male entitlement dismissive legal judicial apparatus insidious culture binge drinking war domestic violence extent war poverty war bouts social narcissism afflict upper classes posed question lisa smith chief sex crimes prosecutor brooklyn district attorney office national fatality review team experienced domestic violence advocates job talk families relevant parties report government entities meant ordinary people intervene terrible happened identifying potential killers"
"Gawker Case Calls Attention to a Go-To Hollywood Lawyer","LOS ANGELES — In Hollywood, everyone knows the go-to lawyers. For divorce, there’s Laura Wasser, now representing Johnny Depp in his split with Amber Heard. For a potential criminal charge, think Blair Berk, who helped Caitlyn Jenner avoid one after a traffic accident in which one person died, or Thomas Mesereau, who got Michael Jackson acquitted. And if it just seems to be a workaday violation of a famous person’s rights, like slapping Reese Witherspoon’s name on jewelry without her permission? That was the sort of case Charles J. Harder was known for — until now. Mr. Harder and his boutique Hollywood firm, Harder, Mirell & Abrams, are suddenly in the limelight. Last week it was revealed that their legal victory for the former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan, in his suit against Gawker Media over publication of a sex video, was secretly underwritten by the Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel. Hulk Hogan, whose real name is Terry Gene Bollea, was awarded $140 million. Mr. Thiel, a PayPal founder, had a longstanding dispute with Gawker, which published an article in 2007 saying he was gay. The case, and Mr. Thiel’s place in it, have sent a shudder through many in the news media. At issue is whether Mr. Thiel’s role in the case will motivate other wealthy and powerful people to settle scores by giving money to litigants whose causes they support. (The Gawker case is likely to continue with appeals, and a June 10 hearing into matters that are still pending.) A smaller question, but almost as fascinating in Los Angeles legal circles, is this: How did Mr. Harder, a 46-year-old Beverly Hills lawyer who has specialized in protecting stars from having their rights infringed upon by retailers and marketers, wind up in the middle of this free speech fight? Mr. Harder would not comment for this article. But a close look at his résumé, and conversations with people familiar with his background, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality strictures, suggest that Mr. Harder’s emergence as a power player happened as most things do in Hollywood. That is, through a combination of grit, talent, shrewd calculation — and knowing the right people. Mr. Harder’s growing connections with celebrities, their representatives and well-heeled entrepreneurs was clearly rooted in a legal action filed in 2009 in state and federal courts here. In those interrelated cases, Mr. Harder represented six famous actresses — Sandra Bullock, Michelle Pfeiffer, Cameron Diaz, Mandy Moore, Kate Hudson and Diane Keaton — against a group of computer retailers and other companies accused of a somewhat mundane violation. The actresses’ images appeared in catalogs and on websites, on the screens of various devices offered for sale. After working its way through the courts and mediation, that dispute ended in confidential settlements and dismissal. For Mr. Harder, the outcome was successful enough to set a pattern for succeeding cases that found him and his colleagues, in quick succession, filing various privacy rights claims for a growing client list that included George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Bradley Cooper, Liam Neeson, Jude Law, Halle Berry, Tyra Banks, Clint Eastwood and Ms. Witherspoon. The claims and the outcomes — settlements, rather than trials — were often similar. In one departure, Mr. Harder in 2011 fought all the way through trial to a $15 million verdict for the producer Vittorio Cecchi Gori in a complicated dispute with a former colleague, Gianni Nunnari, over rights in films that included “300,” “The Departed” and “Shutter Island.” At least once before, Mr. Harder has tangled with Gawker, in 2012 on behalf of Lena Dunham. He demanded that the site take down a posting of Ms. Dunham’s book proposal, which it largely did, though it continued to display fragments and commentary. In early October 2012, Gawker refused a demand by Mr. Bollea’s longtime lawyer, David Houston, that it remove the sex video from its site. Mr. Harder — then at the firm Wolf, Rifkin, Shapiro, Schulman & Rabkin — was retained and quickly filed suit. Whether Mr. Thiel had assured funding at that point is unclear. But Mr. Harder and his colleagues were confident enough of their footing to start their own firm the following January, taking Mr. Bollea and other clients with them. During the Gawker trial, Mr. Harder, though lead counsel, played a relatively small role in the handling of witnesses, who were often questioned by others. But he currently represents clients in two additional suits against Gawker. One was filed this month in a Boston federal court by Shiva Ayyadurai, who claims he invented email, and another was filed in January in a Manhattan federal court by Ashley Terrill, a journalist. It is not known if Mr. Thiel has played any role in supporting those suits. Harder, Mirell & Abrams currently has its offices in a small, fashionable building adjoining the Beverly Wilshire Hotel on Rodeo Drive. It is near the Century City quarters of much larger law firms like Ziffren Brittenham and Jackoway Tyerman, and talent representatives like the Creative Artists Agency. It is also a short drive from the San Fernando Valley, where Mr. Harder grew up. He attended Montclair College Preparatory School, now closed, in Van Nuys, and did his undergraduate work at the University of California, Santa Cruz. After receiving a law degree from Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, Mr. Harder clerked briefly for Judge A. Andrew Hauk, who was then at the United States District Court for the Central District of California in Los Angeles. Mr. Harder then spent about a year with the Lavely & Singer law firm. The firm and its principal partners, John H. Lavely Jr. and Martin D. Singer, are known as fierce defenders of prominent celebrities like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone. But Mr. Harder did little trial work for the firm, either then or during a second stint at Lavely & Singer. In between, he worked for a web company, Load Media Network. In 2001, a case he was working on received attention in The New York Times. His client, Wendy Withers, was told not to report to work at a financially troubled New York ad agency after having left her previous job. It was a modest claim, and — unlike the Hulk Hogan case, with its huge award — it was settled. Ms. Withers collected two months’ pay.","los angeles hollywood lawyers divorce laura wasser representing johnny depp split amber heard potential criminal charge blair berk helped caitlyn jenner avoid traffic accident person died thomas mesereau michael jackson acquitted workaday violation famous person rights slapping reese witherspoon jewelry permission sort charles harder harder boutique hollywood firm harder mirell abrams suddenly limelight week revealed legal victory professional wrestler hulk hogan suit gawker media publication sex video secretly underwritten silicon valley billionaire peter thiel hulk hogan real terry gene bollea awarded $ million thiel paypal founder longstanding dispute gawker published article gay thiel shudder news media issue thiel role motivate wealthy powerful people settle scores giving money litigants support gawker continue appeals june hearing matters pending question fascinating los angeles legal circles harder beverly hills lawyer specialized protecting stars rights infringed retailers marketers wind middle free speech fight harder comment article close résumé conversations people familiar background spoke condition anonymity confidentiality strictures suggest harder emergence power player happened hollywood combination grit talent shrewd calculation knowing people harder growing connections celebrities representatives heeled entrepreneurs rooted legal action filed federal courts interrelated harder represented famous actresses sandra bullock michelle pfeiffer cameron diaz mandy moore kate hudson diane keaton computer retailers companies accused mundane violation actresses images appeared catalogs websites screens devices offered sale courts mediation dispute confidential settlements dismissal harder outcome successful set pattern succeeding found colleagues quick succession filing privacy rights claims growing client list included george clooney julia roberts bradley cooper liam neeson jude law halle berry tyra banks clint eastwood ms witherspoon claims outcomes settlements trials similar departure harder fought trial $ million verdict producer vittorio cecchi gori complicated dispute colleague gianni nunnari rights films included departed shutter island harder tangled gawker behalf lena dunham demanded site posting ms dunham book proposal continued display fragments commentary october gawker refused demand bollea longtime lawyer david houston remove sex video site harder firm wolf rifkin shapiro schulman rabkin retained quickly filed suit thiel assured funding unclear harder colleagues confident footing start firm january taking bollea clients gawker trial harder lead counsel played role handling witnesses questioned represents clients additional suits gawker filed month boston federal court shiva ayyadurai claims invented email filed january manhattan federal court ashley terrill journalist thiel played role supporting suits harder mirell abrams offices fashionable building adjoining beverly wilshire hotel rodeo drive century city quarters larger law firms ziffren brittenham jackoway tyerman talent representatives creative artists agency short drive san fernando valley harder grew attended montclair college preparatory school closed van nuys undergraduate university california santa cruz receiving law degree loyola law school los angeles harder clerked briefly judge andrew hauk united district court central district california los angeles harder spent lavely singer law firm firm principal partners john lavely jr martin singer fierce defenders prominent celebrities arnold schwarzenegger sylvester stallone harder trial firm stint lavely singer web company load media network received attention york times client wendy withers told report financially troubled york ad agency left previous job modest claim unlike hulk hogan huge award settled ms withers collected months pay"

EL ANGEL In a splashy style perhaps influenced by one of its producers, Pedro Almodóvar, the director Luis Ortega recounts the crime spree of the serial killer Carlos Robledo Puch (Lorenzo Ferro), who has been called Argentina’s longest-serving prisoner. FAIL STATE Sporting the imprimatur of Dan Rather, this documentary is an exposé of the for-profit college industry. THE GIRL IN THE SPIDER’S WEB A long way from Buckingham Palace, Claire Foy (“The Crown”) takes over for Rooney Mara and Noomi Rapace as the leather-clad, tatted avenger Lisbeth Salander, in the first film adapted from a book by David Lagercrantz, who continued the series begun by Stieg Larsson. Sverrir Gudnason, Lakeith Stanfield, Vicky Krieps (“Phantom Thread”) and Claes Bang (“The Square”) also star. Fede Alvarez (“Don’t Breathe”) directed. HERE AND NOW In a film with structural similarities to Agnès Varda’s “Cléo From 5 to 7,” Sarah Jessica Parker plays a singer who is trailed over the 24 hours after she receives a dire diagnosis. Common co-stars. IN A RELATIONSHIP Just as things get complicated between a couple played by Emma Roberts and Michael Angarano, her cousin (Dree Hemingway) and his friend (Patrick Gibson) change their status to something, well, less complicated. LEZ BOMB Jenna Laurenzo writes, directs and stars in this comedy about a woman who tries to bring her girlfriend (Caitlin Mehner) to Thanksgiving and come out, in roughly that order. Brandon Michael Hall, Kevin Pollak and Deirdre O’Connell co-star. THE LONG DUMB ROAD Tony Revolori (the trainee bellhop in “The Grand Budapest Hotel”) stars as a 19-year-old who’s bound for California on a road trip and gains a friend and traveling companion (Jason Mantzoukas) when his car breaks down. Hannah Fidell directed. THE NEW ROMANTIC Jessica Barden plays a college senior who begins dating a sugar daddy as research for the school paper. OUTLAW KING David Mackenzie (“Hell or High Water”) directs this epic about Robert the Bruce, an outlaw who became the king of Scotland (and was previously seen in “Braveheart”). The film has been edited since it opened the Toronto International Film Festival, where the reaction seemed largely focused on the undraping of its star, Chris Pine. With Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Florence Pugh. OVERLORD Jovan Adepo plays an American soldier who, as D-Day nears, is dropped into occupied France. He encounters creatures engineered in a Nazi lab. J.J. Abrams is one of the producers. THE OWL’S LEGACY This 1989 television series from Chris Marker (being shown here as a film) looks at how the inventions of ancient Greece have reverberated through the modern world. Each of 13 chapters begins with a Greek-derived word. PIMP Keke Palmer, in what has to count as a huge about-face from her star-making role in “Akeelah and the Bee,” plays a pimp who rises in a cutthroat world. Christine Crokos wrote and directed. POSTCARDS FROM LONDON After more than 20 years away, the New Queer Cinema director Steve McLean (“Postcards From America”) returns to moviemaking with this film starring Harris Dickinson (“Beach Rats”) as a young man who falls in with a group of London escorts. THEY FIGHT Based on a Washington Post article, this documentary follows a youth sports program in Washington, D.C., that’s intended to get teenagers off the streets by introducing them to boxing. TIME FREAK Eager to fix a relationship that fell apart, a physicist (Asa Butterfield) goes back in time to make some tweaks. Sophie Turner plays the object of his affection — and course correction. The writer-director, Andrew Bowler, expanded this feature from a short. WEIGHTLESS Alessandro Nivola plays an isolated, socially maladroit loner who, having largely abandoned society, is reunited with a son. Julianne Nicholson and Johnny Knoxville — yes, of “Jackass” fame — co-star. SHOAH: FOUR SISTERS Claude Lanzmann, who died in July, carved four short movies out of interviews he shot for the making of his monumental “Shoah” (1985). Each focuses on testimony from a different female Holocaust survivor. In the longest, the harrowing “The Hippocratic Oath,” Ruth Elias, a Czechoslovakian Jew, remembers being pregnant at Auschwitz and having Josef Mengele as her physician. JINN A teenager in Los Angeles (Zoe Renee) finds her confusion about her identity thrown into relief when her mother (Simone Missick) converts to Islam. Reviews from South by Southwest were strong. Nijla Mu’min wrote and directed. THE WILD BOYS In Bertrand Mandico’s oddball feature, the wild boys of the title — teenagers sentenced to an island — turn into women after eating magical fruit. They’re played by women from the get-go, though. With Elina Lowensohn as a doctor who has also undergone the transformation. AT ETERNITY’S GATE Drawing on his own eye as a painter, Julian Schnabel tries to give audiences a sense of how Vincent van Gogh saw the world. Stepping into a role inhabited onscreen by Kirk Douglas, Tim Roth and Martin Scorsese, among others, Willem Dafoe plays the Dutch painter during a period of productivity and — in this telling — apparent madness in France. With Oscar Isaac as Paul Gauguin and Rupert Friend as Theo Van Gogh. THE CLOVEHITCH KILLER In a Hitchcockian premise (specifically, what sounds like a spin on his “Suspicion”), a teenager (Charlie Plummer) starts to suspect his father, a scout leader, could be a serial killer. FANTASTIC BEASTS: THE CRIMES OF GRINDELWALD In the continuing expansion of J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter universe, the dastardly Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) has escaped capture, and Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) signs on to help catch him at the behest of a young Dumbledore (Jude Law, joining the series). 55 STEPS Bille August directed this story about a hospitalized psychiatric patient (Helena Bonham Carter) who agrees to let a patients’ rights lawyer (Hilary Swank) represent her. INSTANT FAMILY Mark Wahlberg and Rose Byrne play a couple who adopt three foster siblings in a dramedy that draws on the experiences of Sean Anders, the director. Isabela Moner, Octavia Spencer, Tig Notaro and Margo Martindale also star. JONATHAN Did you think “Dead Ringers” was kinky? Thanks to the wonders of science, two brothers (both played by Ansel Elgort) are forced to share one body. Taking turns works well enough — until they both fall for Suki Waterhouse. THE LAST RACE Warmly received at Sundance, Michael Dweck’s documentary looks at the operations and culture of Riverhead Raceway, the last stock-car racing site on Long Island, as the couple who own it contemplate its future. MISS DALÍ Ventura Pons directs this biopic about the artist’s relationship with his younger sister (played, at different ages, by Sian Phillips and Eulalia Ballart), who influenced his art. MOBILE HOMES Vladimir de Fontenay’s feature stars Imogen Poots as a single, homeless mother who hustles to get by with her 8-year-old son. OF FATHERS AND SONS A prizewinner at Sundance, the director Talal Derki’s documentary follows two boys and their family, a radical jihadist household. SPEED KILLS John Travolta gets a chance to rebound from “Gotti” by playing a speedboat champion who uses his boats as a ferry service for a lucrative drug-smuggling operation. All it needs is one positive review. UNDER THE WIRE The war correspondent Marie Colvin — played by Rosamund Pike in the current biopic “A Private War” — was killed in Homs, Syria, in 2012. Retracing how she covered the conflict that took her life, this documentary views the story through the eyes of the photographer Paul Conroy, who wrote a memoir of the same title about his experiences working with Colvin. WELCOME HOME A couple (Aaron Paul and Emily Ratajkowski) making a concerted effort to jump-start their flagging romance with an Italian vacation run into trouble when a handsome neighbor comes a-calling. Any number of ominous possible scenarios present themselves. George Ratliff (“Joshua”) directed. WIDOWS A team of Chicago criminals’ bereaved wives (Viola Davis, Michelle Rodriguez and Elizabeth Debicki) forge a tentative alliance to execute the heist that their husbands never got to pull off. Updating a British TV production, the director, Steve McQueen (“12 Years a Slave”) and his co-screenwriter, Gillian Flynn (“Gone Girl”), have more than just the caper on their minds; the story comments on police brutality and the city’s machine politics. The cast is all-star even on the margins, with Cynthia Erivo, Colin Farrell, Brian Tyree Henry, Liam Neeson, Daniel Kaluuya and Robert Duvall. CREED II “Rocky” got its sequels, and so now does “Creed.” Michael B. Jordan returns as Adonis Creed (son of Carl Weathers’s Apollo) and Sylvester Stallone, now 72, returns as the Italian Stallion, Adonis’s mentor. Tessa Thompson is also back. Steven Caple Jr. takes over directing duties from Ryan Coogler (“Black Panther”). GREEN BOOK Peter Farrelly (who with Bobby Farrelly, his brother, is responsible for “There’s Something About Mary” and other sweet-gross comedies) makes his solo directing debut with this drama about the friendship between the African-American pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) and his white driver (Viggo Mortensen) during a tour of the Deep South in 1962. It was a huge crowd-pleaser at the Toronto Film Festival and probably will be everywhere else, too. ¡LAS SANDINISTAS! Jenny Murray’s documentary focuses on the women who fought with the Sandinistas in Nicaragua and their advocacy for reform. RALPH BREAKS THE INTERNET Only a bad take or a good meme can break the internet. But Ralph (John C. Reilly) and Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) of “Wreck-It Ralph” try in a sequel that finds them mixing it up with new characters from across the web. Gal Gadot, Jack McBrayer and Taraji P. Henson also lend their voices. ROBIN HOOD You think it’s too soon to reboot Robin Hood, seen on screen, in the form of Russell Crowe, as recently as 2010? Nonsense: Hollywood should keep giving to poor moviegoers until it gets this legend right. In a version that looks to have a slight martial-arts tinge, Taron Egerton stars as Robin of Loxley, Eve Hewson plays Marian, and Jamie Foxx plays Little John. ROMA Alfonso Cuarón’s first Mexican feature since “Y Tu Mamá También” takes its title from a neighborhood in Mexico City and revolves around the housekeeper (Yalitza Aparicio) for a middle-class family. But a plot description doesn’t do justice to this rapturously received, semi-autobiographical movie, shot in widescreen black-and-white that demands to be seen on the big screen. THE WORLD BEFORE YOUR FEET Matt Green has been walking every block of New York City. His story is told in this documentary. BECOMING ASTRID Astrid is Astrid Lindgren, the creator of Pippi Longstocking, in this biopic starring Alba August as the author in her late teens and early 20s, though played later in life by Maria Fahl Vikander, mother of the Oscar-winning Alicia Vikander. THE FAVOURITE Yorgos Lanthimos (“The Lobster”) brings his absurdist wit to an 18th-century period piece — a dark comedy about cousins (Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone) who compete for the favor of Queen Anne (Olivia Colman). It’s been a festival favourite in Venice and New York. INVISIBLE HANDS Charles Ferguson (“Inside Job”) produced this documentary on how child labor is involved in the supply chains of major industries like food and clothing. SHOPLIFTERS Hirokazu Kore-eda’s poignant drama, which won the Palme d’Or at Cannes in May, concerns a family of petty thieves who take in a young girl. WRITE WHEN YOU GET WORK Stacy Cochran (the Winona Ryder movie “Boys”) directs an indie whose trailer has serious 1996 vibes. Rachel Keller stars as a prep school employee who re-encounters a man from her past (Finn Wittrock). RAMS Gary Hustwit, who made viewers aware of the ubiquity of Helvetica, reveals the artistry of Dieter Rams, a designer known for his invisible, “functionalist” work. Brian Eno wrote the score. ANNA AND THE APOCALYPSE If teenage romance and an evil headmaster weren’t trouble enough, high schoolers suddenly find themselves besieged by zombies over the Christmas season. Oh, and it’s a musical — by turns fun and sad. The project was the brainchild of the Scottish filmmaker Ryan McHenry, who died at 27 of bone cancer. His friends and collaborators worked to bring it to fruition. BLOOD BROTHER The singer Trey Songz stars as a police officer whose old friend (Jack Kesy), just released from prison, seeks revenge on him and others, thinking he was the fall guy for their crime. DRIVERX Patrick Fabian spent the most recent season of “Better Call Saul” trying to keep himself from falling apart. In this movie, he plays someone who’s partway there — an unemployed Los Angeles man who turns to driving for a rideshare service to make ends meet. Will it be “Taxi Driver” for the Uber era? ELECTRO-PYTHAGORAS (A PORTRAIT OF MARTIN BARTLETT) Bartlett was an underheralded Canadian composer who experimented with handmade electronics. This tribute — itself an experimental work — takes its cues from him. ELLIOT: THE LITTLEST REINDEER Blitzen is retiring, which means there’s an opening for a miniature horse who wants to do a reindeer’s job. It’s animated; Josh Hutcherson and Samantha Bee provide two of the voices. HAPPY AS LAZZARO Alice Rohrwacher’s movie won a screenplay prize at Cannes. Said to be inspired by a real-life Italian incident, it begins by immersing viewers in life at an isolated estate that has continued the outlawed practice of sharecropping. Through her protagonist (Adriano Tardiolo), Ms. Rohrwacher blends in elements of the story of Lazarus. IF BEALE STREET COULD TALK Two years after his best-picture-winning “Moonlight,” Barry Jenkins is back with this adaptation of James Baldwin’s 1974 novel, focused on a young couple in Harlem, Tish (KiKi Layne) and Fonny (Stephan James), and what happens when Fonny is wrongfully accused of a rape. It’s a poetic character-driven piece, about race, love and coping. THE MAN WHO MENDS WOMEN This documentary follows the work of Denis Mukwege, the Congolese gynecological surgeon who won the Nobel Peace Prize this year and has become internationally known for “repairing” women who were raped. THE MERCY Colin Firth plays Donald Crowhurst, a real-life British sailor who in 1968 set off on a race to circumnavigate the globe solo. Rachel Weisz also stars. James Marsh (“The Theory of Everything”) directed. MIRAI A boy jealous of his infant sister meets her as a time-traveling teenager in this anime feature from Mamoru Hosoda. NEVER LOOK AWAY Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, whose “The Lives of Others” won a foreign-language Oscar, directs this three-hour-plus historical drama, which follows a German artist (Tom Schilling) over three decades, from the Nazi era through life in divided Germany. The character was inspired by the painter Gerhard Richter. PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF DESIRE Hao Wu’s documentary explores the nature of online fame by looking primarily at two livestreamers who became internet phenoms in China. It won the top documentary prize at South by Southwest. THE POSSESSION OF HANNAH GRACE A woman (Shay Mitchell) working in a morgue has to deal with a body that’s been disfigured — and that may still be possessed. SICILIAN GHOST STORY A girl who is in love with a missing boy — an abduction reportedly based on a real-life Mafia kidnapping — searches for him in this film from Fabio Grassadonia and Antonio Piazza (the festival favorite “Salvo”), who spin headlines into a tale of the fantastic. UNITED SKATES Shown at Tribeca earlier this year, Dyana Winkler and Tina Brown’s documentary examines African-American roller-rink traditions across the country. As rinks close, their loss is slowly extinguishing a skating culture that fed into hip-hop. THE CHARMER Milad Alami’s film — a suspense piece, of sorts — centers on an Iranian in Denmark who is seeking a woman to marry so that he can remain there. The clock is ticking. TYREL At Sundance, Sebastián Silva’s movie drew comparisons to “Get Out.” Jason Mitchell plays a man who travels to upstate New York for a birthday party — and discovers that he’ll be the only African-American there for the whole weekend. CLARA’S GHOST For her feature writing and directing debut, the comedy scion Bridey Elliott — the daughter of Chris Elliott and the granddaughter of Bob and Ray — casts her parents and her sister (Abby Elliott) in a movie about a dysfunctional family. Mom (Paula Niedert Elliott), in particular, has issues, which include interacting with a ghost. THE GREAT PRETENDER A French playwright (Maëlle Poésy) writes about her fraught relationship, then falls in love with the lead actor (Keith Poulson), with whom the lead actress (Esther Garrel) is in love. The workhorse indie filmmaker Nathan Silver (“Thirst Street”) directed. ASHER Ron Perlman plays an ex-Mossad agent who confronts demons from his past. Famke Janssen co-stars; Michael Caton-Jones (“Basic Instinct 2”) directed. BACK ROADS The actor Alex Pettyfer (“I Am Number Four”) makes his directorial debut and stars as a young man raising his siblings; his mother (Juliette Lewis) is in prison for killing his father. BE NATURAL: THE UNTOLD STORY OF ALICE GUY-BLACHÉ Jodie Foster narrates this documentary about the woman who is widely considered the first female filmmaker. She began directing movies in 1896. BEN IS BACK Peter Hedges, who already tackled Thanksgiving in “Pieces of April,” directs his son Lucas Hedges in the role of a 19-year-old drug addict who comes home for Christmas. His mother (Julia Roberts) fears he won’t restrain himself for long. BERNIE THE DOLPHIN Two siblings hatch a plan to release a dolphin that once saved the sister’s life and is now in captivity. DIVIDE AND CONQUER: THE STORY OF ROGER AILES Alexis Bloom (“Bright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds”) directs this look at the career of Roger Ailes, the longtime chairman and chief executive of Fox News. The documentary examines how he shaped politics and journalism before he was ousted in 2016 after a sexual harassment scandal. DUMPLIN’ Danielle Macdonald (“Patti Cake$”) plays a Texas teenager of size who signs up for a beauty pageant to make a point about double standards. Dolly Parton made original recordings for the soundtrack. THE INVISIBLES Claus Räfle’s film focuses on four Jews who survived the Holocaust hiding in Berlin, the capital of the Nazi regime. MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS Saoirse Ronan is Mary Stuart, who as queen of Scotland laid claim to the English throne, occupied by Elizabeth I (Margot Robbie). No spoilers on which one was ultimately beheaded. The screenplay is by Beau Willimon, who knows a thing or two about these sorts of machinations from “House of Cards.” Josie Rourke directed. THE PARTY’S JUST BEGINNING In a confident, thorny feature directorial debut, Karen Gillan (“Doctor Who,” “Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle”) stars as a self-destructive 24-year-old in Inverness, Scotland. SWIMMING WITH MEN Rob Brydon (Steve Coogan’s sparring partner in the “Trip” movies) joins a group of synchronized swimmers who eventually decide to compete to be world champions. VOX LUX The actor turned director Brady Corbet’s stylish and troubling movie sketches a tenuous parallel between a pop star’s rise and moments of headline-grabbing violence. Opening in 1999, it follows the creation — “genesis,” to use the term in the film — of a singer who as a teenager (Raffey Cassidy) survives a Columbine-like school shooting and then becomes a nationwide celebrity after performing at a memorial service. Once the movie jumps forward in time, she is played by Natalie Portman. Sia wrote the original songs; Jude Law and Stacy Martin also star. BIRD BOX Based on the book by Josh Malerman, Susanne Bier’s film stars Sandra Bullock as a mother who must lead her children to safety — without being able to see. Trevante Rhodes, Sarah Paulson and John Malkovich also star. CAPERNAUM In Nadine Labaki’s drama, which won a prize at Cannes, a 12-year-old is suing his parents in court in Lebanon. Through flashbacks to his childhood in the direst poverty, we find out why. DEAD SOULS Wang Bing (“’Til Madness Do Us Part”) is known for making arduous but rewarding documentaries. “Dead Souls” — which runs more than eight hours — has already garnered comparisons to “Shoah.” The film presents the testimonies of a group of survivors of Chinese re-education camps, sent there in a 1957 purge by the Communist Party. THE HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT Seven years after being declared persona non grata at Cannes, Lars von Trier returned to the festival this year to poke the organizers in the eye. Clearly designed to provoke outrage, the film stars Matt Dillon as a serial killer. His murder spree is presented as a sort of allegory for von Trier’s body of work, movies that detractors say revel in cruelty toward women (“Dancer in the Dark,” “Dogville”). Uma Thurman and Riley Keough play two of the victims. THE INSUFFERABLE GROO That would be Stephen Groo, a quixotic, no-budget filmmaker who improbably cast Jack Black in a movie. KHRUSTALYOV, MY CAR! A longtime favorite of champions of the Russian director Aleksei German (1938-2013), this bleak, vulgar and suffocating-by-design 1998 period piece is only now getting a formal release. A brain surgeon is caught up in a real-life purge of Jewish physicians — then returned to Moscow to attend Stalin on his deathbed. LOTS OF KIDS, A MONKEY AND A CASTLE A Spanish matriarch saved — among other objects — two bones from her great-grandmother. Unfortunately, she also lost them. The search for the missing bones, and the deep dive into the family’s history that comes with it, is the subject of this lighthearted documentary. MORTAL ENGINES Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens — the screenwriting team of “Lord of the Rings” — go seriously “Mad Max” with this adaptation of the first book in a series by Philip Reeve, which takes place in a dystopian world where major cities have wheels and pick on smaller cities. Basically, Earth has become “Monster Trucks.” Christian Rivers, a longtime storyboard and effects artist for Jackson, directed. THE MULE The idea of Clint Eastwood, who is now 88, playing a drug courier may seem far-fetched, but it shouldn’t: This star’s second directorial feature this year — and first major acting role in six years — is based on a New York Times Magazine article about a real-life mule for the Sinaloa cartel. Nick Schenk, the screenwriter of Eastwood’s “Gran Torino,” did the script. Bradley Cooper co-stars. NEVER-ENDING MAN: HAYAO MIYAZAKI This documentary focuses on the beloved and recently un-retired animator (“Spirited Away”) as he makes a short using computer-generated animation instead of his famous hand-drawn work. THE QUAKE San Francisco? Los Angeles? Tokyo? Nope, Oslo: Kristoffer Joner (the bad guy who got punked by Wolf Blitzer in “Mission: Impossible — Fallout”) warns of impending spikes on the Richter scale in Norway. SPIDER-MAN: INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE This umpteenth Spider-Man reboot actually tries something different: It’s animated, from a script by Phil Lord (who directed “The Lego Movie” with Christopher Miller), and it has a new angle: A teenager, Miles Morales (voiced by Shameik Moore), becomes a trainee Spider-Man under the tutelage of Peter Parker (Jake Johnson) This installment adds some diversity to the series — Morales is black and Latino — and there are multiple Spider-Persons, including Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld). THAT WAY MADNESS LIES … Sandra Luckow directs a documentary that examines what it perceives as flaws in the mental-health care system, looking at it through the story of her brother, who refused treatment. MARY POPPINS RETURNS First Christopher Robin grew up. Now the children from “Mary Poppins” need revisiting from their old nanny, who has magically transformed into Emily Blunt. Lin Manuel-Miranda, playing a lamplighter, could probably sing a killer “Chim Chim Cher-ee.” Dick Van Dyke appears as well. Rob Marshall, whose track record with screen musicals includes “Chicago” and “Nine,” directed. AQUAMAN The DC Comics movie universe doubles back from “Justice League” to give Aquaman — half-human, half-scion of Atlantis — a movie of his own. Jason Momoa definitely has a bit of that Poseidon look going. With Amber Heard. James Wan directed. AVICII: TRUE STORIES This documentary looks at the career of Tim Bergling, known professionally as Avicii, the Swedish electronic dance music producer, D.J. and songwriter who died at 28 in April of an apparent suicide. BETWEEN WORLDS Nicolas Cage already starred in one bereavement-themed fantasia this year, “Mandy.” In this new movie, he tries to help a woman (Franka Potente) whose daughter is in a coma. The daughter wakes up, which would seem joyous — were she not also possessed by the spirit of the Cage character’s dead wife. BUMBLEBEE Has the “Transformers” series finally turned its attention to human characters? This spinoff involves a teenager (Hailee Steinfeld) who finds out that her beat-up VW bug transforms into the robot Bumblebee. Travis Knight (“Kubo and the Two Strings”) directed. COLD WAR In luscious black-and-white, the Polish director Pawel Pawlikowski (“Ida”) tells a story of love and estrangement involving a singer (Joanna Kulig) and a pianist (Tomasz Kot), as they separate and reunite on both sides of the Iron Curtain over 15 years. THE LAST RESORT This documentary looks back to the 1970s, when Miami Beach was (even more of) a haven for Jewish retirees, helped by the work of two photographers who captured the scene. SECOND ACT Jennifer Lopez plays a woman who is hired for a high-powered Madison Avenue job after someone gives her online identity a makeover — with significant embellishments. Leah Remini, Vanessa Hudgens and Milo Ventimiglia co-star. WELCOME TO MARWEN Making the case for Robert Zemeckis as an auteur, Dave Kehr, writing in The New York Times in 2000, noted that his recent films had “all focused, quite movingly, on a single theme — emotionally isolated characters who try to break out by inventing relationships with imaginary beings.” So it’s only logical that he would gravitate to the story of the outsider artist Mark Hogancamp (Steve Carell), who, having suffered brain damage in an assault, began making a model of a fictional World War II-era town and cast himself as a war hero. Leslie Mann and Janelle Monáe co-star in a production that also showcases the director’s digital wizardry. DESTROYER Nicole Kidman puts in an uncharacteristically dark turn as a Southern California detective who returns to investigating the gang she went undercover to infiltrate years earlier. It’s as much a character study as it is a crime movie. Sebastian Stan and Tatiana Maslany also star. Karyn Kusama directed. HOLMES & WATSON Nope, it’s not another entry in the Robert Downey Jr. series. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are played by Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly, and any parody is intentional. With Ralph Fiennes as Moriarty and Rebecca Hall. Etan Cohen directed. ON THE BASIS OF SEX Felicity Jones plays Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in her years as a lawyer fighting gender discrimination, a battle chronicled earlier this year in the hit documentary “RBG.” Armie Hammer plays her husband, Marty Ginsburg. Mimi Leder directed. The screenplay is by the justice’s nephew Daniel Stiepleman. VICE Christian Bale has gone to extreme lengths to vanish into roles before. And although he is not fat or bald, he will become those things as Dick Cheney, whom he plays in this biopic from Adam McKay. On the basis of the trailer, Bale does an uncanny impression of the former vice president’s voice and cadences. Expect irreverence alongside pointed political commentary from the director of “The Big Short.” The casting is poised somewhere between Oscar bait and choices made on a dare: Amy Adams as Lynne Cheney. Steve Carell as Donald Rumsfeld. Tyler Perry as Colin Powell. Sam Rockwell as George W. Bush. STAN & OLLIE Not to be confused with “Holmes & Watson,” this month’s other duo movie starring John C. Reilly, this biopic finds Laurel (Steve Coogan) and Hardy (Reilly) late in their careers, touring Britain with a stage show in 1953. Nina Arianda and Shirley Henderson play their wives. Compiled with the assistance of Sara Aridi.","highly select list noteworthy films due season release dates subject change front runner time midterm elections hugh jackman plays democratic presidential

"How Celebrities Keep Their Weddings a Secret","A “secret” celebrity wedding: In the age of social media, it seems like a Hollywood oxymoron on the order of “late-career comeback” and “no-fault divorce.” Even so, to judge by the number of celebrities trying off-the-grid nuptials, far from the prying lenses of the paparazzi (Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux, married Aug. 5 in a quiet ceremony at their home in the Bel-Air section of Los Angeles, are but the latest), the underground wedding has become one of Hollywood’s biggest status symbols. Cameron Diaz and Benji Madden, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, and Zooey Deschanel and Jacob Pechenik are among the many couples to attract intense media speculation over their stealth unions, which generally managed to unfold in private without the tabloid scrum. The famous friends who earn coveted invitations seem to acknowledge that, among the celebrity class, the No. 1 wedding gift on every registry these days is silence. “I’m afraid to even talk about that wedding because everyone is on top-secret lockdown,” Howard Stern, a guest at the Aniston-Theroux ceremony, said on a recent SiriusXM broadcast. (“Howard Stern discretion,” of course, is another oxymoron; the Medusa-haired shock jock promptly let slip that Jimmy Kimmel had presided over the ceremony.) No matter how much stars try to hide under the dome of silence, leaks are inevitable. Ms. Aniston and her Ducati-loving husband, for instance, tried a major head-fake before their ceremony, reportedly hiding their party gear in a vacant house next door and telling guests they were being invited to Mr. Theroux’s 44th birthday party, not a wedding. But within days, the tabloid-hungry public already knew about the guest list (which included Lisa Kudrow, Orlando Bloom and Lake Bell), Ms. Aniston’s dress (summery, boho-inspired) and their cake (Muppets-themed). TMZ and People published numerous photos of the backyard setup, taken from high overhead, and grainy shots of a vendor carrying the cake. But no photos have emerged of the couple themselves, denying the gossip-hungry public even a mental image of the affair, the kind that can linger for years after, say, a royal wedding. The truth is, the best efforts of the stars are not enough. Even the most discreet wedding is a team effort, so it comes down to the wedding planners, charged with overseeing the whole affair, to make sure that everyone, guests included, observes the lockdown. “There’s no midpoint: It’s absolute secrecy, or it’s everywhere,” said Marcy Blum, the planner for several celebrity weddings, including LeBron James’s 2013 hyper-private event (the printed invitations did not even list a time or place). “Because of cellphones, TMZ doesn’t have to stake out a wedding for there to be a leak. Everyone’s an investigative reporter.” Here are a few A-list planners discussing the new rules of the hush-hush celebrity wedding. (The following interviews have been edited and condensed). In Weddings, Too, It’s Location, Location, Location: “The secret is, look for venues that are hard to get to. Anything with ocean access is easier to get to for the press. If secrecy is really a problem, do it inside a building. Then the chances of people seeing it are a lot less. Or you can use a tent. But sadly, there lies the problem. How do you make it beautiful and romantic without compromising the vision by having to cover it all up?” — JoAnn Gregoli, an owner of Elegant Occasions in New York. Keep Your Friends Close and Your Guest List Closer: “If you really want to keep it secret, you have to invite fewer than 100 guests, and that is really pushing it. Second, like in the case of Jennifer Aniston, or Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel, it helps if people have no idea where they are going. When we planned LeBron’s wedding, we sent an invitation that said it was going to take place somewhere on the West Coast, but we didn’t give details until we called them back, after we vetted them to make sure it was an invited guest or their representative. Still, it’s rarely foolproof. One of their save-the-dates showed up on TMZ.” — Marcy Blum, Marcy Blum Associates, New York. Secure the Perimeter: “The problem is, once something leaks to one press outlet, it’s like sharks feeding on a dead carcass. They swarm. I did a wedding a few years back in the Hamptons involving some very well-known artists in the music industry, and we had security every seven feet around the perimeter of the property. The media will sit outside, waiting for leaks. And they don’t just show up the day of. They’ll be talking to people who provide luxury trailers, the generators, it could be the tenting company. We have to plant security four or five days in advance.” — Andrea Correale, Elegant Affairs Caterers, New York. Establish a Paper Trail: “Very often in an event of this magnitude, you have two to three hundred people on site. It’s not just the caterers you have to worry about. There are lots of vendors involved: musicians, people renting lounge furniture, fabric people. You have to make sure you get the proper forms signed so no one in the other companies leaks word, either. You dot your I’s and cross your T’s, but in the end of the day, you can’t control everything.” — Andrea Correale. Spare the Phones, Spoil the Party: “Unless you’re going to make every single guest including Cousin Harry sign a nondisclosure agreement, then nothing is foolproof. So we leave a letter in the guest rooms saying: ‘We really want you to be present for this. Please don’t bring a cellphone, if you do bring it we’re going to ask you to leave it at the check-in desk.’ Then we organize them and put them in separate plastic bags with the number on the outside. It’s not about the couple being so paranoid. There are a lot of non-famous people there. It could be a cousin, an old college roommate. It’s about the couple not wanting the famous guests to be bothered by the non-famous guests for selfies. It’s a wedding, not a red carpet event.” — Marcy Blum. No One Is Above the Law: “With guests, you can say ‘Please don’t take pictures,’ but you know they’re going to Instagram it, so we have just said, ‘Please deposit your phones.’ You can ask them to shut them off, but they won’t. Some people take great umbrage and don’t want to give up their phones. There was a celebrity once who told me, ‘Hey, I’m not going to do it.’ We just had to watch that person. You can always tell what they’re doing. If someone takes a picture just to take a picture, they put the phone down. But if they take a shot and start typing simultaneously, they’re leaking it out.” — JoAnn Gregoli. Consider Calling in the Air Force: “Really only in the last year, these magazines are buying drones. They are able to launch them, hover them low. You could drop a drone outfitted with video cameras into a property almost undetected. At one event I did recently in the Hamptons, one came in over the water. There is no way we could have stopped it. They are a lot more annoying than helicopters ever were. Before, with a helicopter, you had a TV crew on board, and you’d have to wait for the show to air. Now with drones, they can put it on YouTube, on Periscope, on Twitter, almost in real time. To the world of celebrities, that is horrible. What do you do: Shoot them down?” — JoAnn Gregoli.","secret celebrity wedding age social media hollywood oxymoron late career comeback fault divorce judge celebrities grid nuptials prying lenses paparazzi jennifer aniston justin theroux married aug quiet ceremony home bel air section los angeles underground wedding hollywood biggest status symbols cameron diaz benji madden johnny depp amber heard zooey deschanel jacob pechenik couples attract intense media speculation stealth unions managed unfold private tabloid scrum famous friends earn coveted invitations acknowledge celebrity class wedding gift registry days silence afraid talk wedding top secret lockdown howard stern guest aniston theroux ceremony recent siriusxm broadcast howard stern discretion oxymoron medusa haired shock jock promptly slip jimmy kimmel presided ceremony matter stars hide dome silence leaks inevitable ms aniston ducati loving husband instance major head fake ceremony reportedly hiding party gear vacant house door telling guests invited theroux th birthday party wedding days tabloid hungry public guest list included lisa kudrow orlando bloom lake bell ms aniston dress summery boho inspired cake muppets themed tmz people published numerous photos backyard setup overhead grainy shots vendor carrying cake photos emerged couple denying gossip hungry public mental image affair linger royal wedding truth efforts stars discreet wedding team effort wedding planners charged overseeing affair guests included observes lockdown midpoint absolute secrecy marcy blum planner celebrity weddings including lebron james hyper private event printed invitations list time cellphones tmz doesn stake wedding leak investigative reporter list planners discussing rules hush hush celebrity wedding interviews edited condensed weddings location location location secret venues hard ocean access easier press secrecy inside building chances people lot tent sadly lies beautiful romantic compromising vision cover joann gregoli owner elegant occasions york friends close guest list closer secret invite fewer guests pushing jennifer aniston justin timberlake jessica biel helps people idea planned lebron wedding invitation west coast didn details called vetted invited guest representative rarely foolproof save dates tmz marcy blum marcy blum associates york secure perimeter leaks press outlet sharks feeding dead carcass swarm wedding hamptons involving artists music industry security feet perimeter property media sit waiting leaks don day ll talking people provide luxury trailers generators tenting company plant security days advance andrea correale elegant affairs caterers york establish paper trail event magnitude hundred people site caterers worry lots vendors involved musicians people renting lounge furniture fabric people proper forms signed companies leaks word dot cross day control andrea correale spare phones spoil party single guest including cousin harry sign nondisclosure agreement foolproof leave letter guest don bring cellphone bring leave check desk organize separate plastic bags couple paranoid lot famous people cousin college roommate couple famous guests bothered famous guests selfies wedding red carpet event marcy blum law guests don pictures instagram deposit phones shut won people umbrage don phones celebrity told hey watch person takes picture picture phone shot start typing simultaneously leaking joann gregoli calling air force magazines buying drones launch hover low drop drone outfitted video cameras property undetected event recently hamptons water stopped lot annoying helicopters helicopter tv crew board wait air drones youtube periscope twitter real time world celebrities horrible shoot joann gregoli"
"How to Tell if Someone Is Lying and 8 More Conversation Tips","The staring contest lasted 14 seconds before Amanda de Cadenet, best known for interviewing bold women with boldfaced names, broke the silence with “I can’t take it anymore!” She was delivering instruction in an interview technique: It is sometimes important to keep quiet, and even to stare down one’s interview subject, in the hope that the stare-ee will try to fill the silence with her truth. It can be uncomfortable to be on the receiving end of that silence, as Ms. de Cadenet herself knows. She was exposed to scrutiny at an early age. As she chronicles in her new book, “It’s Messy,” she was a teenage runaway who got into drugs and was pregnant at 19, with her daughter Atlanta Noo de Cadenet Taylor, by her first husband, John Taylor of Duran Duran. In her televised series, “The Conversation,” Ms. de Cadenet, 45, has interviewed women such as Hillary Clinton, Ivanka Trump, Issa Rae and Lady Gaga. “One of the big adjustments was to learn to listen,” she said of becoming an effective interviewer. In our talking-head, Twitter-finger culture, learning to listen, engage and observe are valuable skills, whether you are a journalist, employer or friend. Here are some tips and tricks that Ms. de Cadenet said she has gleaned along the way. How to tell if someone is lying Two words: body language. Ms. de Cadenet said she learned how to read body language as a means of survival as a 15-year-old when she was in a juvenile detention center. “You can sense whether someone is retreating from you: They look away, they cross their arms, they’ll shift their focus, they will turn their body away,” she said. Also, pay attention to their eyes. “When I was interviewing Hillary Clinton, I knew when I’d ask her something that she wasn’t going to give me the complete truth because she would break eye contact with me.” How to have a hard conversation Call out the elephant in the room. In Ms. de Cadenet’s book, she outlines a conversation she had with a friend who confessed to her that she was sleeping with a married man. To have a difficult talk, Ms. de Cadenet starts by acknowledging the awkwardness. “Just say, ‘This is really uncomfortable for both of us. This is not a conversation I want to have. And I know you don’t. But I think we have to talk about this,’” she said. How to create that safe space Be trustworthy. “You have to be someone that when your friends tell you something, they don’t hear it back from other people.” Also, be willing to share your own feelings. “I’ve been privileged to be able to be a part of some of my girlfriends’ lives at their breaking points,” said Ms. de Cadenet, who was friends with Gwyneth Paltrow when she “uncoupled” from Chris Martin, as well as with Amber Heard when she accused Johnny Depp of domestic violence. “And they will be in the trenches with you at some point. Over time, that creates safety.” How do you know how much to share about yourself? Consider the impact. Ms. de Cadenet has had her life blasted on the British tabloids since she was a teenager, and she does not advocate oversharing, especially on social media. “I think we are in major T.M.I. culture right now,” she said. “I share personal things about myself in the context of my interviews and in ‘It’s Messy’ — but that’s 20 percent of my life. There is another 80 percent that hasn’t been talked about, or it’s not all the information. It’s enough that I needed to illustrate that story.” How to know when to have a conversation Research and know the facts. For some parents, talking about pornography with their children at a young age seems inappropriate. But Ms. de Cadenet knows that young people come across, and search for, pornography at extremely young ages. She has spoken to her 10-year-old children about pornography, she said. “Other parents would be like, ‘Oh, that is way too young,’ but what I know from my research is: It isn’t too young.” How to deal with small talk Just take a hard pass. “Just get rid of it immediately,” she said. “Do not sit down with that person again. I hate small talk! I can’t do it.” How to reach out to someone in a crisis Keep putting your hand out, and need nothing back. “I had one girlfriend recently who had a monumental loss in her life, and I just sent her texts every day every day that just said, ‘I love you,’ or I sent her a heart emoji,” she said. “And I don’t expect a response.” How do you get people to share their most vulnerable self? “What would you tell your 14-year-old self?” is the question that Ms. de Cadenet has found connects people to their most vulnerable and genuine self. She said the age of 14 is a transitional age between girlhood and womanhood, a time that often evokes tears and emotions. How do you empower women in a professional setting? Be willing to not be liked. “It’s not about being liked. It’s about your idea being heard,” said Ms. de Cadenet, who was recently in a scenario in which a group full of men kept talking over her and she had to ask them to stop. “That didn’t go down very well. Do they like me? No. Do I care? No. Was I heard? Yes.”","staring contest lasted amanda de cadenet interviewing bold women boldfaced names broke silence anymore delivering instruction interview technique quiet stare interview subject hope stare ee fill silence truth uncomfortable receiving silence ms de cadenet exposed scrutiny age chronicles book messy teenage runaway drugs pregnant daughter atlanta noo de cadenet taylor husband john taylor duran duran televised series conversation ms de cadenet interviewed women hillary clinton ivanka trump issa rae lady gaga adjustments learn listen effective interviewer talking head twitter finger culture learning listen engage observe valuable skills journalist employer friend tips tricks ms de cadenet gleaned lying words body language ms de cadenet learned read body language means survival juvenile detention center sense retreating cross arms ll shift focus body pay attention eyes interviewing hillary clinton wasn complete truth break eye contact hard conversation call elephant ms de cadenet book outlines conversation friend confessed sleeping married difficult talk ms de cadenet starts acknowledging awkwardness uncomfortable conversation don talk create safe space trustworthy friends don hear people share feelings ve privileged girlfriends lives breaking ms de cadenet friends gwyneth paltrow uncoupled chris martin amber heard accused johnny depp domestic violence trenches time creates safety share impact ms de cadenet life blasted british tabloids teenager advocate oversharing social media major culture share personal context interviews messy percent life percent hasn talked information illustrate story conversation research parents talking pornography children age inappropriate ms de cadenet people search pornography extremely ages spoken children pornography parents research isn deal talk hard pass rid immediately sit person hate talk reach crisis putting hand girlfriend recently monumental loss life texts day day love heart emoji don expect response people share vulnerable question ms de cadenet found connects people vulnerable genuine age transitional age girlhood womanhood time evokes tears emotions empower women professional setting idea heard ms de cadenet recently scenario talking stop didn care heard"
"Irreplaceable Plant Specimens an ‘Obscene’ Loss After Being Incinerated in Quarantine Flub","Around the world, specimens of plants mounted on what are known as herbarium sheets are routinely lent among researchers and shipped with the care and protection of a jeweler sending an emerald necklace. So when a package of more than 100 specimens — some of them irreplaceable and rich in scientific value — survived a 10,200-mile trip only to be mistakenly incinerated because of communication and paperwork mistakes, the plant research community was aghast. The French museum that sent the specimens quickly suspended further loans to Australia, where the material was destroyed after the authorities there said it did not meet biodiversity security rules. The episode made headlines on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation this week and quickly reverberated among researchers. Karl Niklas, a professor of plant science at Cornell University, called the losses “obscene.” He said thousands of specimens are routinely swapped every day without a hitch and that cases of errant destruction are rare. “It’s heartbreaking,” he said. “It’s difficult to hear about.” The specimens were sent in December by the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, destined for the Queensland Herbarium in Brisbane, Australia. They arrived in the country in early January with a declared value on the package of $2, the Australian Department of Agriculture and Water Resources said in an emailed statement. “There had been no prior notification of the package’s arrival or its significance,” the statement said. The department reviewed the package’s documentation and determined the specimens did not comply with import and biosecurity rules, which are meant to keep out pests and diseases. The department said it asked for more information but did not get a response within the required 30 days. It was later discovered that the herbarium initially sent a response to an incorrect email address. Additional documentation arrived on March 3, but it was deemed insufficient and the department again requested more information. Absent further documentation, goods being held that have a declared low value are routinely destroyed, the statement said, adding that by the time the specimens were incinerated, at the end of March, they had been held for 76 days — 46 days longer than required. The department said it was a “deeply regrettable occurrence” and conceded that “unintentionally proceeding with destruction of the specimens was premature while communication between the department and the intended recipient was ongoing.” It said it was reviewing what happened, had implemented steps to prevent a future occurrence and met on Monday with herbarium collections managers. Herbarium officials could not be reached to comment. All of that was little solace to Michel Guiraud, the director of collections at the National Museum of Natural History, who said the scientific losses were significant. The shipment included “type specimens,” which are rare samples highly sought by botanists who use them as a baseline to compare other plants. Worse, some of the specimens were collected at the end of the 18th century by the French botanist Jacques-Julien Houtou de La Billardière. “The problem is that we were warned of nothing,” Mr. Guiraud said. The museum sent specimens from the Lagenophora family, which includes daisies, and was notified that a quarantine document was missing. “We filled it out and sent it,” Mr. Guiraud said, adding that the paperwork was in order. Two weeks later, the museum learned the specimens had been destroyed. Mr. Guiraud said he was all the more angry to learn through news accounts that a similar episode occurred with six lichen specimens on loan from New Zealand that were mistakenly destroyed by Australian authorities. All that was left of the destroyed plants from the Paris museum were digitized images, which are kept for those who want to see a specimen without traveling or requesting a loan. “It happened,” Mr. Guiraud said of the destruction. “But it is out of the question that it will happen again.” Biosecurity is a watchword in Australia, which screens about 138 million mail pieces each year to guard against harm to its agricultural industries, valued at $59 billion. Its stringent enforcement of quarantine rules made headlines last year when the actor Johnny Depp got into a feud with Barnaby Joyce, Australia’s deputy prime minister and minister for agriculture and water resources. The trouble began when Amber Heard, Mr. Depp’s wife at the time, arrived with their two Yorkshire terriers, Pistol and Boo, and left her private jet without declaring the dogs, who were supposed to be placed in quarantine. Ms. Heard pleaded guilty to providing false information on her passenger card, and prosecutors dropped the more serious charges.","world specimens plants mounted herbarium sheets routinely lent researchers shipped care protection jeweler sending emerald necklace package specimens irreplaceable rich scientific survived mile trip mistakenly incinerated communication paperwork mistakes plant research community aghast french museum specimens quickly suspended loans australia material destroyed authorities meet biodiversity security rules episode headlines australian broadcasting corporation week quickly reverberated researchers karl niklas professor plant science cornell university called losses obscene thousands specimens routinely swapped day hitch errant destruction rare heartbreaking difficult hear specimens december national museum natural history paris destined queensland herbarium brisbane australia arrived country january declared package $ australian department agriculture water resources emailed statement prior notification package arrival significance statement department reviewed package documentation determined specimens comply import biosecurity rules meant pests diseases department information response required days discovered herbarium initially response incorrect email address additional documentation arrived march deemed insufficient department requested information absent documentation held declared low routinely destroyed statement adding time specimens incinerated march held days days required department deeply regrettable occurrence conceded unintentionally proceeding destruction specimens premature communication department intended recipient ongoing reviewing happened implemented steps prevent future occurrence met monday herbarium collections managers herbarium officials reached comment solace michel guiraud director collections national museum natural history scientific losses significant shipment included type specimens rare samples highly sought botanists baseline compare plants worse specimens collected th century french botanist jacques julien houtou de la billardière warned guiraud museum specimens lagenophora family includes daisies notified quarantine document missing filled guiraud adding paperwork weeks museum learned specimens destroyed guiraud angry learn news accounts similar episode occurred lichen specimens loan zealand mistakenly destroyed australian authorities left destroyed plants paris museum digitized images specimen traveling requesting loan happened guiraud destruction question happen biosecurity watchword australia screens million mail pieces guard harm agricultural industries valued $ billion stringent enforcement quarantine rules headlines actor johnny depp feud barnaby joyce australia deputy prime minister minister agriculture water resources trouble amber heard depp wife time arrived yorkshire terriers pistol boo left private jet declaring dogs supposed quarantine ms heard pleaded guilty providing false information passenger card prosecutors dropped charges"
"Johnny Depp and Amber Heard to Face Off in Defamation Trial","The actor Johnny Depp could not convince a judge in London that he was innocent of allegations that he had abused his former wife, the actress Amber Heard, but in a trial starting Monday, the actor will take his defamation complaint to a jury in Virginia. The U.S. trial centers on a lawsuit Mr. Depp filed against Ms. Heard, who wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post in 2018, after the couple divorced, saying she had become a “public figure representing domestic abuse.” The piece did not mention Mr. Depp by name, but the actor has asserted in court papers that it clearly referred to their relationship, and that his reputation and career were “devastated” as a result. During three years of legal sparring in Virginia, Mr. Depp, 58, and Ms. Heard, 35, have shared pages of lurid details from their varying accounts of their marriage. Ms. Heard’s descriptions of “volatile and violent” episodes with Mr. Depp throughout their relationship included his slapping her, head-butting her, throwing her to the ground, and pulling out clumps of her hair, according to court papers. In his lawsuit, filed in March 2019, Mr. Depp denied that he was a domestic abuser and said Ms. Heard’s accusations were an “elaborate hoax” intended to boost her public persona — one that succeeded in making her a “darling of the #MeToo movement.” Mr. Depp has said Ms. Heard had been the perpetrator of abuse, accusing her in court papers of punching, kicking him and throwing objects, including a vodka bottle that he said shattered on the countertop and severed the tip of one of his fingers. “Mr. Depp brings this defamation action to clear his name,” the actor’s lawsuit said. Ms. Heard said in court papers that she has never attacked Mr. Depp except in self-defense or in defense of her younger sister, and that Mr. Depp severed the tip of his finger when he smashed a phone against the wall during a violent outburst. “I have never physically abused anyone,” she wrote. “I know what that does to people.” The trial in Fairfax County Circuit Court is expected to last about six weeks and will begin with jury selection. The proceedings will be televised, all but guaranteeing that they will become a public spectacle. Both parties are expected to testify. In addition, Ms. Heard’s list of potential witnesses includes several celebrities — among them Elon Musk and James Franco — and the evidence the two sides intend to put forward includes text messages between the couple, medical records and surveillance footage from Los Angeles, where they lived together. (Ms. Heard exchanged texts with Mr. Musk about her marriage that were used as evidence in the British case, and she said in that trial that Mr. Franco saw the bruises on her face after an altercation that is in dispute.) There are also weighty legal questions in play as jurors will be asked to review, not only Mr. Depp’s claim, but also issues raised in a countersuit Ms. Heard filed in 2020. It accused Mr. Depp of defaming her through his former lawyer, who gave statements to the media saying that Ms. Heard’s abuse claims were a hoax. The trial is one of the most high profile examples of defamation cases that have arisen from the #MeToo era, and lawyers around the country are following it closely. Jamie R. Abrams, a law professor at the University of Louisville Brandeis School of Law who has written about these cases, said this is one of a number in which the litigation ultimately becomes a trial over the truth of what happened, as lawyers on both sides seek to prove that their client could not have committed defamation if they were speaking honestly. “I think legislators, litigators, and scholars are all watching this case and its parallels to see where the law settles after such a period of turbulence,” she said. Another key question is how the British trial will factor in. A judge in London found in 2020 that there was “overwhelming evidence” that Mr. Depp had assaulted Ms. Heard repeatedly during their marriage, writing that Mr. Depp had put the actress “in fear of her life.” Lawyers for Ms. Heard sought to convince the judge in Virginia to embrace her British counterpart’s findings, arguing that the issue at the core of both cases was the same: whether Mr. Depp had abused Ms. Heard. Judge Penney S. Azcarate declined to do so, writing in her decision that Ms. Heard was not the defendant in the British case — it was a British newspaper that called Mr. Depp a “wife beater” — and Mr. Depp did not have access to a jury trial there. Judges often exclude previous trials such as this one from the evidence a jury is allowed to consider and even restrict mention of such background so the jury will not be unfairly swayed, Lee Berlik, a defamation lawyer in Virginia, said. But Ms. Heard’s lawyers can argue that aspects of it are relevant to her case and therefore should be shared with the jury. “Naturally, Amber Heard is going to want to do everything she can to make the jury aware of that because Johnny Depp lost,” Mr. Berlik said, referring to the London libel case. “Conversely, Johnny Depp will want to do everything he can to make sure it is not mentioned.” In the courtroom. A defamation trial involving the formerly married actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard is currently underway in Fairfax County Circuit Court in Virginia. Here is what to know about the case: The case. Mr. Depp brought a defamation case against Ms. Heard in an effort to clear his name from domestic abuse allegations that she has made against him and that he denies. The jury is also considering a countersuit from Ms. Heard, who claims that Mr. Depp defamed her when his former lawyer said her domestic abuse claims were a “hoax.” Ms. Heard’s op-ed. Mr. Depp’s suit was filed in response to an op-ed Ms. Heard wrote for The Washington Post in 2018 in which she described herself as a “public figure representing domestic abuse.” Though she did not mention her former husband’s name, he and his lawyers have argued that she was clearly referring to their relationship. The end of their marriage. Ms. Heard filed for divorce in 2017, just over a year after the pair had married. She also obtained a temporary restraining order against the actor after accusing him of hitting her. She later withdrew that claim, and in January 2017, the couple agreed to a $7 million divorce settlement. An earlier defamation case. The trial follows another case Mr. Depp brought in London in 2020 against The Sun newspaper, which called him a “wife beater” in a headline. In that trial, a judge found that there was “overwhelming evidence” that he had assaulted Ms. Heard repeatedly during their marriage. The domestic abuse claims. In the 2020 trial, Ms. Heard accused her former husband of assaulting her first in 2013, after they began dating, and detailed other instances in which he slapped her, head-butted her and threw her to the ground. Mr. Depp has since accused her of punching him, kicking him and throwing objects at him. Lawyers for Mr. Depp and Ms. Heard declined to comment on the specifics of how the British case would be handled at the American trial. The former couple met when Ms. Heard was cast as Mr. Depp’s love interest in the 2011 film “The Rum Diary” and were married in 2015. The next year, a court in California granted Ms. Heard a temporary domestic violence restraining order against Mr. Depp after she alleged “emotional, verbal and physical abuse” in a petition to the court, detailing a recent incident in which she said Mr. Depp violently shoved her to the floor and threw a champagne bottle at the wall after her 30th birthday party, and another in which she said he threw a cellphone at her, hitting her in the face. In court papers, Mr. Depp has denied Ms. Heard’s version of events, saying she punched him in the face repeatedly after he was late for her birthday dinner and accusing her of faking a bruise on her face to obtain the restraining order, which she ultimately withdrew. (Ms. Heard dismissed her petition for a longer term restraining order as part of their divorce agreement, her lawyers wrote in court papers.) After the couple divorced, The Washington Post published Ms. Heard’s op-ed, but the newspaper has not been named as a defendant in the case. Online, the op-ed was titled, “I spoke up against sexual violence — and faced our culture’s wrath.” “A movie I was attached to recast my role,” the op-ed read. “I had just shot a two-year campaign as the face of a global fashion brand, and the company dropped me. Questions arose as to whether I would be able to keep my role of Mera in the movies ‘Justice League’ and ‘Aquaman.’” Though it catalogs the damage she said she suffered by going public, the op-ed did not detail her allegations of the abuse she says she suffered at the hands of Mr. Depp. The op-ed identified Ms. Heard as an ambassador on women’s rights at the American Civil Liberties Union, and she said in court papers that the A.C.L.U. — whose executive director, Anthony Romero, is also listed as a potential witness in the trial — suggested that Ms. Heard write the piece and submitted it to the newspaper. Mr. Depp claims in the lawsuit that after the op-ed was published, the damage to his career and reputation was “swift and severe.” Days after, Disney confirmed that Mr. Depp would not be returning to one of his most prominent film roles as Captain Jack Sparrow in a possible “Pirates of the Caribbean” reboot, according to his lawsuit. “He was denied an opportunity to reprise that role immediately on the heels of Ms. Heard’s false and defamatory op-ed,” the lawsuit said.","actor johnny depp convince judge london innocent allegations abused wife actress amber heard trial starting monday actor

"Johnny Depp and Amber Heard’s Courtroom Face-Off: An Explainer","LONDON — For the past three weeks, the attention of movie fans has been focused on one place: London’s grand, neo-Gothic Royal Courts of Justice. Not because of a shoot. Almost every day since July 7, Johnny Depp has walked into Court 13 here, where he is suing the owners of The Sun, a British tabloid newspaper, and its executive editor, Dan Wootton, for libel over a 2018 article that called Depp a “wife beater” and said there was “overwhelming evidence” that he had assaulted the actress Amber Heard during the pair’s marriage. Depp denies all the claims. The newspaper has argued in court that it was “entirely accurate and true” to call Depp a “wife beater,” and Heard has been testifying this week on its behalf. (In English law, unlike in the United States, the burden of proof lies on the publisher in such cases.) Depp, 57, testified at length earlier in the case, accusing Heard, 34, of violence toward him — claims she has denied in turn. The proceedings have aired unsavory details of the marriage — from their drug and alcohol use, to the moment excrement was found in a bed. And it has potential implications for both actors’ careers, with the verdict likely either to give Heard more prominence in the #MeToo movement or to leave her accused of having hijacked it, said Nick Wallis, a journalist who has live-tweeted much of the trial proceedings and has put court documents online. Only one party seemed to be benefiting so far, Wallis added: The Sun. The case had generated so much publicity for the paper that “even if it loses, it’s a win-win,” he said. Here’s what’s happened so far and what’s next. Depp and Heard met while making “The Rum Diary” in 2011, a film based on a book by Hunter S. Thompson. They married in February 2015, but Heard filed for divorce just over a year later, and obtained a temporary restraining order against Depp after accusing him of hitting her. She said at the time, according to The Associated Press, that she had “endured excessive emotional, verbal and physical abuse” in the relationship. She withdrew those claims the day before a restraining order hearing was scheduled, and the divorce was finalized with a $7 million settlement. In a joint statement, the two declared: “Neither party has made false accusations for financial gain. There was never any intent of physical or emotional harm.” But the allegations did not go away. The Sun article appeared in April 2018. A few months later, Heard published an opinion piece in The Washington Post titled, “I spoke up against sexual violence — and faced our culture’s wrath. That has to change.” Depp is suing Heard for defamation in the United States over that article, which he says led to him being dropped from the “Pirates of the Caribbean” movie franchise. On Monday, Heard told the court that Depp often put her in “life-threatening” situations. “I had been for years, for years, Johnny’s punching bag,” she added on Tuesday. On Wednesday, she detailed an episode in Australia in which she said he threw bottles at her “like grenades or bombs.” In pretrial documents, Heard listed 14 times when she said Depp assaulted her. The first occurred in early 2013, Heard said in a pretrial statement, when the couple were sitting on a couch talking about one of Depp’s tattoos. She said it had originally read “Winona,” in reference to Winona Ryder, his former partner, but that he had changed it to read “wino.” Heard said she had laughed during the conversation, and in response Depp hit her three times. “It felt like my eye popped out,” she added of the third strike, saying it knocked her off balance and to the floor. In later incidents, Heard claims, Depp grabbed her by the hair, choked her, head-butted her and repeatedly punched her, on top of emotional abuse and other controlling behavior. She said on Wednesday that his behavior was “so confusing because when he was clean and sober, he was wonderful and that part of him I loved so much.” News Group Newspapers — The Sun’s publisher — claims Depp’s memory of the couple’s time together has been impaired by heavy drug and alcohol use. He has admitted use of both at times in the relationship, but said his tolerance for substances was high. Depp denies the incidents. He told the court that whenever the couple had an argument he would retreat, sometimes hiding in bathrooms. “I would try to go to my own corner, as it were,” he said when asked about one incident. “I thought it important that we separate before things got out of hand.” Witnesses including a former estate manager for Depp and a former assistant to Heard have testified in his favor. Depp has repeatedly portrayed Heard as an aggressor, provoking arguments. In the incident in Australia, Depp told the court, Heard threw a vodka bottle at him, severing the tip of one of his fingers. In the courtroom. A defamation trial involving the formerly married actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard is currently underway in Fairfax County Circuit Court in Virginia.

In the 2020 trial, Ms. Heard accused her former husband of assaulting her first in 2013, after they began dating, and detailed other instances in which he slapped her, head-butted her and threw her to the ground. Mr. Depp has since accused her of punching him, kicking him and throwing objects at him. Heard denies all claims that she was violent toward him, and said that Depp must have severed the fingertip himself, potentially in the process of ripping a phone off the wall and smashing it beside her face repeatedly. On Monday, Heard admitted she had thrown “pots and pans” at Depp, but said it was “only to escape him.” She also acknowledged hitting him once but only to protect her sister, who she thought he was about to push down some stairs. “I will never forget it,” she said of that moment. “It was the first time after all these years that I actually struck him back.” The names of numerous celebrities have popped up in the case, such as Elon Musk — with whom Depp accuses Heard of having had an affair. (Text messages between Heard and Musk have been read out in court. Heard says they were not involved until after the relationship with Depp had ended.) Winona Ryder and Vanessa Paradis, Depp’s former partners, were expected to testify via video link, until Depp’s team decided not to call them. “I was so absolutely shocked, confused and upset when I heard the accusations against him,” Ryder said in a witness statement. “I do not want to call anyone a liar, but from my experience of Johnny it is impossible to believe that such horrific allegations are true,” she added. Paradis’s statement also offered support to Depp. The case, which is being heard without a jury, continues, with final arguments not expected until Tuesday. The judge, Mr. Justice Nicol, will then take time to consider his ruling. That will depend on the ruling, said Richard Danbury, a journalism lecturer at City University in London, in a telephone interview. A strong ruling against the newspaper could result in a “chill” on journalists’ ability to report or investigate domestic abuse stories, he said. But there might be a more immediate effect, he added, on anyone considering similar legal action: “Your whole marriage comes out.” Wallis, the journalist, said the trial had sometimes focused on sordid moments because so much of the case turned on personal testimony. The two legal teams were seeking to “destroy the character of the person so their side of the story can’t be believed.” They were trying to portray Heard or Depp as “so mendacious, so drug-addled or irresponsible that they could be capable of making everything up,” he added. Athalie Matthews, of the law firm Farrer & Co., said the trial “had the effect of placing the damning allegation at the heart of the case — that Mr. Depp is a ‘wife beater’ — into a giant global megaphone. As a result of the trial, millions more people have been made aware of The Sun’s allegation than would have been the case if Mr. Depp had not sued.” The case “might well deter” more celebrities from litigating, she added.","london past weeks attention movie fans focused london grand neo gothic royal courts justice shoot day july johnny depp walked court suing owners sun british tabloid newspaper

"Johnny Depp and Amber Heard’s Fight Left Home Damaged, Witness Says","The property manager at an Australian home where Johnny Depp and Amber Heard stayed in 2015 during their tempestuous marriage testified on Monday about the damage he surveyed after one of their most fractious clashes. The manager, Ben King, described touring the place after the fight and finding a scene of broken glass, blood drippings, a damaged bar top and a collapsed Ping-Pong table. It was the aftermath of an episode that is emblematic of the dueling accusations that have filled the defamation case filed by Mr. Depp against Ms. Heard. Mr. Depp has said that during that fight Ms. Heard hurled a vodka bottle at him that shattered and severed his fingertip. She has countered that he severed it himself when he smashed a phone against a wall. Mr. King testified that he found Mr. Depp’s fingertip in a “scrunched up” piece of paper amid the wreckage. The property manager’s testimony came after Mr. Depp finished a fourth and final day on the stand in Fairfax County Circuit Court in Virginia. During his testimony, Mr. Depp has described how his relationship with Ms. Heard dissolved, sometimes using florid descriptions or pantomiming blows he said she had aimed at him and suggesting he had been “broken” by the experience. “That’s psychologically, emotionally where I was,” he testified on Monday while being questioned by one of his lawyers. “I was at the end.” In court papers, Ms. Heard has accused Mr. Depp of repeatedly abusing her throughout their relationship, alleging that he slapped her, kicked her, head-butted her and tore clumps of hair out of her scalp. In 2018, she wrote an opinion piece in The Washington Post, describing how her career had been negatively affected by becoming a “public figure representing domestic abuse.” The piece did not name Mr. Depp, but he has argued that it clearly was alluding to him and harmed his career and reputation. Mr. Depp previously sued The Sun newspaper in England for printing a headline that called him a “wife beater.” He lost that case in 2020. Mr. Depp and Ms. Heard met when Ms. Heard was cast as Mr. Depp’s love interest in the 2011 film “The Rum Diary.” They were married in 2015 and divorced in 2017. Testifying on Monday, Mr. Depp said he learned in a published interview with a Disney executive, dated two days after Ms. Heard’s opinion piece came out, that he would not be returning to the “Pirates of the Caribbean” franchise for a potential sixth film. Mr. Depp testified that he said he had wanted the characters in the films — including his character, Captain Jack Sparrow — to have a “proper goodbye.” Mr. Depp appeared to be referring to a 2018 Hollywood Reporter interview with Sean Bailey, a Disney executive, in which the reporter asked, “Can Pirates survive without Johnny Depp?” Mr. Bailey responded that he wanted to bring in “a new energy and vitality” to a possible “Pirates” reboot. “Suddenly I was guilty until proven innocent,” Mr. Depp said. During cross-examination of Mr. Depp on Monday, Ms. Heard’s lawyers argued that the actor’s reputation had been in decline well before the 2018 article, citing a 2017 Hollywood Reporter article calling him a “star in crisis” and another describing the “diminishing returns of Johnny Depp.” In the courtroom. A defamation trial involving the formerly married actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard is currently underway in Fairfax County Circuit Court in Virginia. Here is what to know about the case: The case. Mr. Depp brought a defamation case against Ms. Heard in an effort to clear his name from domestic abuse allegations that she has made against him and that he denies.

Mr. Depp has since accused her of punching him, kicking him and throwing objects at him. “It’s a stack of hit pieces generated by Ms. Heard’s publicity team,” Mr. Depp responded. Mr. Depp has testified that he never hit Ms. Heard — nor any woman — and that she was the aggressor in the relationship, insulting him using demeaning language that escalated into physical violence. Ms. Heard has denied hitting Mr. Depp except in self-defense or in defense of her sister. There can be little doubt that the atmosphere between the two was sometimes incendiary. Mr. Depp was confronted during cross-examination with text messages to others in which he referred to Ms. Heard using vulgar insults; in response to a particularly graphic and violent text message about Ms. Heard, Mr. Depp said on Monday, “It’s irreverent and abstract humor.” In his testimony, Mr. King said that he had worked at a residence belonging to Mr. Depp in London and also at the house in Australia, where Mr. Depp stayed while working on one of the “Pirates” films. He testified that he had seen and heard many arguments between Mr. Depp and Ms. Heard. Those tended to follow a pattern, Mr. King added, in which Mr. Depp would leave a room and Ms. Heard would follow. Mr. King said one dispute in London began when Ms. Heard asked Mr. Depp why he had taken his hand away from her, adding that he thought she had sounded like a “spoiled teenage child.” Mr. King testified that he was called to the house after Mr. Depp’s finger had been severed, and he recalled Ms. Heard was sobbing as he entered. The premises were in disarray, he said. A chunk had been broken out of a marble staircase. Blood had stained the carpet and streaked several walls. In a lower level of the home, Mr. King said, there was a smell of alcohol and cans strewn near a bar. He began looking in that area and said he soon found the fingertip, “nested” in a blood-streaked piece of paper. Mr. King then placed it into a plastic bag so that it could be rushed to a hospital, he added. Mr. Depp’s finger was later surgically repaired.","property manager australian home johnny depp amber heard stayed tempestuous marriage testified monday damage surveyed fractious clashes manager ben king touring fight finding scene broken glass blood drippings damaged bar top collapsed ping pong table aftermath episode emblematic dueling accusations filled defamation filed depp ms heard depp fight ms heard hurled vodka bottle shattered severed fingertip countered severed smashed phone wall king testified found depp fingertip scrunched piece paper amid wreckage property manager testimony depp finished fourth final day stand fairfax county circuit court virginia testimony depp relationship ms heard dissolved florid descriptions pantomiming blows aimed suggesting broken experience psychologically emotionally testified monday questioned lawyers court papers ms heard accused depp repeatedly abusing relationship alleging slapped kicked head butted tore clumps hair scalp wrote opinion piece washington post describing career negatively affected public figure representing domestic abuse piece depp argued alluding harmed career reputation depp previously sued sun newspaper england printing headline called wife beater lost depp ms heard met ms heard cast depp love film rum diary married divorced testifying monday depp learned published interview disney executive dated days ms heard opinion piece returning pirates caribbean franchise potential sixth film depp testified characters films including character captain jack sparrow proper goodbye depp appeared referring hollywood reporter interview sean bailey disney executive reporter pirates survive johnny depp bailey responded bring energy vitality pirates reboot suddenly guilty proven innocent depp cross examination depp monday ms heard lawyers argued actor reputation decline article citing hollywood reporter article calling star crisis describing diminishing returns johnny depp courtroom defamation trial involving married actors johnny depp amber heard underway fairfax county circuit court virginia depp brought defamation ms heard effort domestic abuse allegations denies jury countersuit ms heard claims depp defamed lawyer domestic abuse claims hoax ms heard op ed depp suit filed response op ed ms heard wrote washington post public figure representing domestic abuse mention husband lawyers argued referring relationship marriage ms heard filed divorce pair married obtained temporary restraining actor accusing hitting withdrew claim january couple agreed $ million divorce settlement earlier defamation trial depp brought london sun newspaper called wife beater headline trial judge found overwhelming evidence assaulted ms heard repeatedly marriage domestic abuse claims trial ms heard accused husband assaulting dating detailed instances slapped head butted threw ground depp accused punching kicking throwing objects stack hit pieces generated ms heard publicity team depp responded depp testified hit ms heard woman aggressor relationship insulting demeaning language escalated physical violence ms heard denied hitting depp defense defense sister doubt atmosphere incendiary depp confronted cross examination text messages referred ms heard vulgar insults response graphic violent text message ms heard depp monday irreverent abstract humor testimony king residence belonging depp london house australia depp stayed pirates films testified heard arguments depp ms heard tended follow pattern king added depp leave ms heard follow king dispute london ms heard depp hand adding sounded spoiled teenage child king testified called house depp finger severed recalled ms heard sobbing entered premises disarray chunk broken marble staircase blood stained carpet streaked walls lower level home king smell alcohol cans strewn bar found fingertip nested blood streaked piece paper king plastic bag rushed hospital added depp finger surgically repaired"
"Johnny Depp and Australia’s Agriculture Minister in a Feud With Legs","An international feud between a celebrated Hollywood actor and an Australian government official, already a strange spectacle, keeps getting stranger. In one corner is the actor, Johnny Depp, who said on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” on Monday that the official looked as if he had been inbred with a tomato. In the other corner is Barnaby Joyce, Australia’s deputy prime minister and agriculture minister. He said on Wednesday that he was “inside” Mr. Depp’s head, like Hannibal Lecter, the killer cannibal in the movie “The Silence of the Lambs.” Why, a fair person might wonder, would a high-ranking Australian official and a cooler-than-thou actor descend into name-calling across oceans? Why did it lead to perhaps Mr. Depp’s worst acting performance ever, in the form of a video apology? Does it have something to do with a threat to kill healthy dogs? Valid questions, all. Let’s catch you up. Mr. Depp, 52, known for playing such offbeat roles as Hunter S. Thompson, Edward Scissorhands and Captain Jack Sparrow in the “Pirates of the Caribbean” movies, was in Australia last year to film the fifth installment in the franchise. The trouble began when his wife, Amber Heard, 30, arrived in Australia on April 21, 2015, with their two Yorkshire terriers, Pistol and Boo, to visit him. The actress had disembarked from her private jet without declaring the dogs, who were supposed to be placed in quarantine upon arrival. Her lawyer, Jeremy Kirk, later said that Ms. Heard believed that Mr. Depp’s staff had taken care of the pets’ paperwork. They had not. The Australian authorities were not happy, and set down the conditions for the couple to make things right. Mr. Joyce had strong words about Mr. Depp: “It basically looks like he sneaked them in,” he declared in May 2015. “Mr. Depp either has to take his dogs back to California or we’re going to have to euthanize them.” That struck Mr. Depp and Ms. Heard as a tad extreme. Sympathetic observers started a hashtag, #WarOnTerrier, and created a petition asking for canine leniency. But celebrities aren’t above the law, Mr. Joyce maintained. “If you start letting movie stars, even though they’ve been the ‘sexiest man alive’ twice, to come into our nation, then why don’t we just break the laws for everybody?” Mr. Joyce said. In the end, Mr. Depp and Ms. Heard agreed to send the pups back to the United States. Then, on Wednesday night, word came that she had filed for divorce, after 15 months of marriage. In April, Ms. Heard pleaded guilty to providing false information on her passenger card. Prosecutors dropped the more serious charges, which could have led to two years in jail and a fine of 20,000 Australian dollars (about $15,350). transcript AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HANDOUT - AP CLIENTS ONLY // Gold Coast - 17 April 2016 // SOUNDBITE (English) Amber Heard Actor, Johnny Depp, Actor: Heard: “Australia is a wonderful island with a treasure trove of unique plants, animals and people.” Depp “It has to be protected” Heard: “Australia is free of many pests and diseases that are commonplace around the world. That is why Australia has to have such strong biosecurity laws.” Depp: “And Australians are just as unique, both warm and direct. When you disrespect Australian law they will tell you firmly.” Heard: “I am truly sorry that Pistol and Boo were not declared. Protecting Australia is important.” Depp: “Declare everything when you enter Australia, thanks.” // AuBC - NO ACCESS AUSTRALIA // Canberra - 18 April 2016 // SOUNDBITE (English) Barnaby Joyce, Australia’s Deputy Prime Minister: “I am happy that Ms Heard has admitted that she was wrong and as such that clearly shows that our position in pursuit of this was correct. I’m also happy that within those, the outcome now we have basically a piece by Mr Depp and Ms Heard which clearly underpins Australia’s biosecurity requirements. It’s incredibly important, every nation has something that they’re ‘red hot’ about and we’re red hot about our biosecurity requirements in this nation. Ms. Heard and Mr. Depp made a video apology, which the Australian government uploaded to YouTube. The video, to put it bluntly, is awkward and quite excruciating to watch. “Australia is free of many pests and diseases that are commonplace around the world,” Ms. Heard says without enthusiasm. “That is why Australia has to have such strong biosecurity laws.” Mr. Depp continues, with the energy of a man who hadn’t had his espresso yet: “And Australians are just as unique, both warm and direct. When you disrespect Australian law, they will tell you firmly.” “I am truly sorry that Pistol and Boo were not declared,” Ms. Heard says. “Protecting Australia is important.” Mr. Depp closes with a passionless word of advice: “Declare everything when you enter Australia. Thanks.” In the courtroom. A defamation trial involving the formerly married actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard is currently underway in Fairfax County Circuit Court in Virginia. Here is what to know about the case: The case. Mr. Depp brought a defamation case against Ms. Heard in an effort to clear his name from domestic abuse allegations that she has made against him and that he denies. The jury is also considering a countersuit from Ms. Heard, who claims that Mr. Depp defamed her when his former lawyer said her domestic abuse claims were a “hoax.” Ms. Heard’s op-ed. Mr. Depp’s suit was filed in response to an op-ed Ms. Heard wrote for The Washington Post in 2018 in which she described herself as a “public figure representing domestic abuse.” Though she did not mention her former husband’s name, he and his lawyers have argued that she was clearly referring to their relationship. The end of their marriage. Ms. Heard filed for divorce in 2017, just over a year after the pair had married. She also obtained a temporary restraining order against the actor after accusing him of hitting her. She later withdrew that claim, and in January 2017, the couple agreed to a $7 million divorce settlement. An earlier defamation case. The trial follows another case Mr. Depp brought in London in 2020 against The Sun newspaper, which called him a “wife beater” in a headline. In that trial, a judge found that there was “overwhelming evidence” that he had assaulted Ms. Heard repeatedly during their marriage. The domestic abuse claims. In the 2020 trial, Ms. Heard accused her former husband of assaulting her first in 2013, after they began dating, and detailed other instances in which he slapped her, head-butted her and threw her to the ground. Mr. Depp has since accused her of punching him, kicking him and throwing objects at him. Mr. Joyce was unimpressed, mocking the couple’s video by saying it looked as if Mr. Depp was “auditioning for ‘The Godfather.’” “I don’t think he’ll get an Academy Award for his performance,” he said, according to the BBC. On “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” Mr. Depp revisited the whole saga, dryly criticizing “the choice they made to utilize the taxpayers’ dollars to globally chase down a couple teacup Yorkies and give them 50 hours to live.” Mr. Kimmel asked who had written the video apology, and Mr. Depp dodged by replying: “A genius.” He said he didn’t watch the iPhone-produced video before it was released “because I didn’t want to kill myself.” Then he turned to the subject of Mr. Joyce, saying: “He looks somehow inbred with a tomato. It’s not a criticism, I was a little worried. He might explode.” Mr. Joyce lobbed his own barbs the next day, telling reporters, “I’m inside his head.” “I’m pulling little strings and pulling little levers. Long after I’ve forgotten about Mr. Depp, he’s remembering me,” he said, according to The Associated Press. “I’m turning into his Hannibal Lecter.” But Mr. Joyce said the case had serious implications, and he thanked Mr. Depp for the publicity given to biosecurity laws. “We can’t have rabies coming into the country,” he said, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. “Who does the fella think he was?”","international feud celebrated hollywood actor australian government official strange spectacle stranger corner actor johnny depp jimmy kimmel live monday official looked inbred tomato corner barnaby joyce australia deputy prime minister agriculture minister wednesday inside depp head hannibal lecter killer cannibal movie silence lambs fair person ranking australian official cooler thou actor descend calling oceans lead depp worst acting performance form video apology threat kill healthy dogs valid questions catch depp playing offbeat roles hunter thompson edward scissorhands captain jack sparrow pirates caribbean movies australia film installment franchise trouble wife amber heard arrived australia april yorkshire terriers pistol boo visit actress disembarked private jet declaring dogs supposed quarantine arrival lawyer jeremy kirk ms heard believed depp staff care pets paperwork australian authorities happy set conditions couple joyce strong words depp basically sneaked declared depp dogs california euthanize struck depp ms heard tad extreme sympathetic observers started hashtag waronterrier created petition canine leniency celebrities aren law joyce maintained start letting movie stars ve sexiest alive nation don break laws joyce depp ms heard agreed send pups united wednesday night word filed divorce months marriage april ms heard pleaded guilty providing false information passenger card prosecutors dropped charges led jail fine australian dollars $ transcript australian government handout ap clients gold coast april soundbite english amber heard actor johnny depp actor heard australia wonderful island treasure trove unique plants animals people depp protected heard australia free pests diseases commonplace world australia strong biosecurity laws depp australians unique warm direct disrespect australian law firmly heard pistol boo declared protecting australia depp declare enter australia aubc access australia canberra april soundbite english barnaby joyce australia deputy prime minister happy ms heard admitted wrong position pursuit correct happy outcome basically piece depp ms heard underpins australia biosecurity requirements incredibly nation red hot red hot biosecurity requirements nation ms heard depp video apology australian government uploaded youtube video bluntly awkward excruciating watch australia free pests diseases commonplace world ms heard enthusiasm australia strong biosecurity laws depp continues energy hadn espresso australians unique warm direct disrespect australian law firmly pistol boo declared ms heard protecting australia depp closes passionless word advice declare enter australia courtroom defamation trial involving married actors johnny depp amber heard underway fairfax county circuit court virginia depp brought defamation ms heard effort domestic abuse allegations denies jury countersuit ms heard claims depp defamed lawyer domestic abuse claims hoax ms heard op ed depp suit filed response op ed ms heard wrote washington post public figure representing domestic abuse mention husband lawyers argued referring relationship marriage ms heard filed divorce pair married obtained temporary restraining actor accusing hitting withdrew claim january couple agreed $ million divorce settlement earlier defamation trial depp brought london sun newspaper called wife beater headline trial judge found overwhelming evidence assaulted ms heard repeatedly marriage domestic abuse claims trial ms heard accused husband assaulting dating detailed instances slapped head butted threw ground depp accused punching kicking throwing objects joyce unimpressed mocking couple video looked depp auditioning godfather don ll academy award performance bbc jimmy kimmel live depp revisited saga dryly criticizing choice utilize taxpayers dollars globally chase couple teacup yorkies hours live kimmel written video apology depp dodged replying genius didn watch iphone produced video released didn kill subject joyce inbred tomato criticism worried explode joyce lobbed barbs day telling reporters inside head pulling strings pulling levers ve forgotten depp remembering press hannibal lecter joyce implications thanked depp publicity biosecurity laws rabies coming country sydney morning herald fella"
"Johnny Depp Case Brings Stan Culture Into the Courtroom","To hear more audio stories from publications like The New York Times, download Audm for iPhone or Android. A frenzied scene materializes four days a week at the Fairfax County Courthouse in Virginia as fans seek seats at the defamation trial between Johnny Depp and his ex-wife Amber Heard. The line to enter the courthouse begins before sunrise. Throughout the day, people appear carrying signs, wearing fan merch and costumes, even walking a pair of alpacas. Nearly all of them are there for Mr. Depp. “We just want to support our captain,” said Jack Baker, 20, who arrived on Monday dressed like an extra in “Pirates of the Caribbean” to film footage for his YouTube channel. “If he goes down with the ship, we’re going down with him.” Maryam Alam, 29, and Alina Alam, 29, had hoped to get into the courthouse, but when they showed up at 7 a.m. they were already too late. Both grew up watching Mr. Depp onscreen — playing such characters as Edward Scissorhands, Captain Jack Sparrow, Willy Wonka — and were eager for the chance to see him in person. “It’s fulfilling a childhood fantasy,” Maryam said. “It’s the reason why everyone else is here.” High-profile celebrity cases have drawn a wide audience ever since Court TV began broadcasting from courtrooms in the 1990s. But the trial of Mr. Depp and Ms. Heard has become a case study in what happens when complex claims are filtered through the lenses of stan culture and social media. In addition to the live coverage on TV, YouTube, and various news and entertainment websites, countless short clips edited for maximum virality have circulated on Instagram and TikTok — “fancams,” in social media parlance, featuring forensic analyses of Mr. Depp’s and Ms. Heard’s trial attire, and courtroom exchanges that have been described as “SAVAGE.” Mr. Depp, 58, is suing Ms. Heard, 36, over an essay she published in The Washington Post in 2018 about sexual violence, in which she described herself as a “public figure representing domestic abuse.” Though Mr. Depp was not named in the article, he has argued that it clearly alluded to him, damaging his reputation and career. (Ms. Heard filed for divorce in 2016 and, soon after, for a restraining order against Mr. Depp, which she was granted.) In his testimony, Mr. Depp denied ever striking Ms. Heard and argued that she was the aggressor in their relationship. The jury is simultaneously considering a defamation countersuit by Ms. Heard against Mr. Depp. Many of the accusations were aired in 2020, during a libel case Mr. Depp brought against The Sun, a British newspaper that ran a headline referring to him as a “wife beater.” The judge ruled that the defendants had shown that what they published was “substantially true,” and Mr. Depp lost the case. While the jury in Virginia has been instructed to carefully weigh the evidence and reach a verdict only after testimony is complete (Ms. Heard has yet to take the stand), and fan-observers have been advised not to react audibly or visibly to either party in the courtroom, the rest of the world is under no such obligation. In a TikTok video captioned “AMBER HEARD CAUGHT LYING AGAIN,” Ethan Trace (2.8 million followers) gleefully recounts how Ms. Heard’s lawyer said in court that the actress used a makeup palette to cover up bruises Mr. Depp gave her during their marriage. The lawyer held up a palette to reinforce her point, and while she did not name the brand, it was identifiable in photos and video from the trial, and internet sleuths quickly named the company, Milani Cosmetics. Milani, the brand, later released a TikTok video that stated the product Ms. Heard’s lawyer showed did not become available until after the couple had separated. (“Milani Cosmetics is not taking a formal stance on the trial, evidence or future outcome of the case,” a spokeswoman wrote in a statement.) “Boom!” Mr. Trace says in the video. “Milani Cosmetics: We love you! Thank you for sharing this!” The video has more than 16 million views. In an email, Mr. Trace explained that he felt Mr. Depp had been treated unfairly by the media. “How could no one be talking about evidence that could possibly prove a man’s innocence after being labeled an ‘abuser’ in the eyes of the public?” he wrote. On April 13, shortly after testimony began, Gawker noted that the TikTok hashtag #justiceforjohnnydepp had received 1.1 billion views. In two weeks, that number has more than quadrupled. As of this writing, #justiceforamberheard has 22 million views. Ms. Heard’s supporters hope that her testimony will shift the dialogue surrounding the trial. “Instead of looking at all these TikToks and everything, I think that people should actually follow the case,” said Carmen Diamandis, 22. “Stans will literally go to any extent to defend anyone,” he said of Mr. Depp’s supporters, adding: “Amber Heard, she has not got that fan base.” Marianne Nafsu, 32, a true crime content creator from Detroit who has posted about the case, said: “I can’t wait to hear her side when she stands trial.” She added that “it’s only fair to listen to both sides and see: Where’s all this coming from?” When asked for a comment on the fan response, Ms. Heard’s lawyers provided her friend Eve Barlow, a music journalist who has been tweeting in support of Ms. Heard.

Mr. Depp has since accused her of punching him, kicking him and throwing objects at him. “The social media landscape is shockingly brutal for Amber,” Ms. Barlow wrote in an email, adding that many of the comments on TikTok and Twitter reflect “misogynist hate.” Mr. Depp’s representatives did not respond to a request for comment. Rachel Louise Snyder, the author of “No Visible Bruises: What We Don’t Know About Domestic Violence Can Kill Us,” acknowledged in an interview that Mr. Depp has certain advantages over Ms. Heard in the court of public opinion. “People will dispense with the same critical eye that they would give anybody else when it comes to someone who is really a beloved figure,” she said. Ms. Snyder added that the case offers a potential counternarrative to common misconceptions of abuse: who can perpetuate it and who can be a victim. “We don’t think about victims as wealthy. We don’t think about victims as men. We don’t think about perpetrators as women,” she said. “I’m not saying that she’s a perpetrator and he’s a victim. I’m just saying that we have an opportunity to look at our own myths and stereotypes around ‘Who’s the victim and who’s the perpetrator?’” (Severe physical violence affects one in four women, according to the National Domestic Violence Hotline, and one in seven men.) On TikTok, many of Mr. Depp’s supporters have posted about a recording in which Ms. Heard says: “Tell the world, Johnny, tell them, ‘I, Johnny Depp, a man, am a victim too of domestic violence,’” and continues, “See how many people believe or side with you.” Scout Robert, 24, was taken aback by Ms. Heard’s words. “When she said that, she made the statement to the world that as a man, you cannot be abused,” she said in an interview. Ms. Robert, who has more than 40,000 followers on TikTok, has posted numerous videos on the platform, in which she has called Ms. Heard a liar, abuser and hypocrite. Some have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times. Ms. Robert said she felt that the #MeToo slogan “believe women” had become overused. Rather, she said, people ought to “listen to women,” while acknowledging “that men can be victims of domestic abuse as well.” Ms. Snyder, likewise, thinks the Depp trial could spur more nuanced conversations about abuse, and how it doesn’t always fall within neatly prescribed boundaries. “Maybe he’s a victim, maybe he’s an abuser, maybe he’s a little bit of both,” she said. “Same for her.” Michael Lee Pope contributed reporting from Fairfax, Va.

"Johnny Depp Confronted With Texts and Audio at Libel Trial","Lawyers for Amber Heard worked on Thursday to point out inconsistencies in Johnny Depp’s testimony in the defamation trial between the formerly married actors, presenting text messages sent by Mr. Depp and audio recordings of the couple’s arguments. Ms. Heard has asserted in court papers that Mr. Depp repeatedly assaulted her throughout their marriage, including during a fight in 2015 in which she said he “reeled back” and head-butted her in the face, “bashing” her nose. Mr. Depp has testified that he never struck Ms. Heard during their relationship and accused her of being the aggressor. Mr. Depp said on the stand Thursday that he vehemently disagreed that he had head-butted Ms. Heard that night, saying that he was only trying to restrain her and that it was “not impossible for them to bump.” Confronted with a recording of himself saying, “I head butted you in the forehead,” using an expletive, and “That doesn’t break a nose,” Mr. Depp said he had been trying to placate Ms. Heard by repeating her version of events. “There was not an intentional head butt,” the actor said, “and if you want to have a peaceful conversation with Ms. Heard, you might have to placate just a little bit.” The trial in Fairfax County Circuit Court revolves around an op-ed Ms. Heard wrote in 2018 for The Washington Post in which she said she was a “public figure representing domestic abuse.” But the trial testimony has gone well beyond an analysis of what Ms. Heard wrote. It includes a lengthy review of physical altercations between the actors, the differing accounts they have given about each and an extensive review of Mr. Depp’s use of drugs and alcohol. On Thursday, a lawyer for Ms. Heard, Ben Rottenborn, had Mr. Depp recall how he wrote bloody messages on the wall and other objects after part of his finger was severed in 2015. In his testimony, Mr. Depp affirmed that he had written a message on a mirror with his injured finger that referred to Ms. Heard — then his wife — as “easy Amber,” and another on a lampshade that said, “Good luck and be careful at top.” “I thought it was good advice,” Mr. Depp replied. But what the two sides disagree on is how Mr. Depp’s finger was severed, while the couple were in Australia for the filming of the fifth “Pirates of the Caribbean” movie. Mr. Depp has testified that Ms. Heard threw a handle of vodka, which shattered on his hand and severed his finger. In court papers, Ms. Heard has said he severed his own finger when smashing a phone “to smithereens” amid a bout of physical violence against her. Ms. Heard — who is countersuing Mr. Depp for defamation after his former lawyer called her accusations a hoax — has written in court papers that Mr. Depp’s drug and alcohol use was central to the cycle of abuse, writing, “Johnny would become volatile and violent when under the influence of drugs and alcohol, then contrite and apologetic when he would sober up.” Mr. Depp testified on Tuesday that Ms. Heard’s depiction of his drug and alcohol use was “grossly embellished” and that he was once addicted to an opioid but had successfully detoxed. Parts of the cross-examination from Ms. Heard’s lawyer sought to show that Mr. Depp had misrepresented his drug use. Mr. Rottenborn questioned Mr. Depp about a particular incident in 2014 on which the actor’s account diverges from Ms. Heard’s. She has written in court papers that Mr. Depp had been “drinking heavily” on a private flight and threw objects at her, screamed obscenities and kicked her in the back. He was angry, she said, about a romantic scene she had been filming with the actor James Franco. She said he then locked himself in the plane’s bathroom and passed out, according to court papers. Mr. Depp testified on Wednesday that he had taken opioids and had perhaps had a glass of champagne on that flight, adding that he had locked himself in the bathroom because Ms. Heard had been “actively searching for a way to instigate a fight with me.” Ms. Heard has said in court papers that she has never struck Mr. Depp except in self-defense or in defense of her sister.

Here is what to know about the case: The case.

Mr. Depp has since accused her of punching him, kicking him and throwing objects at him. Mr. Rottenborn sought to suggest Mr. Depp’s behavior had been more volatile than he had acknowledged, confronting him with a text message he had sent to a friend, the actor Paul Bettany, in reference to the flight. In the text, Mr. Depp rattled off an exaggerated list of the drugs and alcohol he had ingested and said they left him “screaming obscenities and insulting” anyone who got near. Mr. Depp suggested in response that there was a certain creativity to the way he speaks in text messages. “When I write a text, especially if I’m in a particularly impassioned place, it’s a canvas, it’s a painting,” Mr. Depp said. “You choose your colors.” Mr. Rottenborn questioned Mr. Depp on the drugs he used and with whom, prompting the actor to say — in a comment that drew laughs from the courtroom — “I once gave Marilyn Manson a pill so that he would stop talking so much.” During cross-examination, Mr. Depp was confronted with several text messages to others in which he referred to Ms. Heard using insults and obscenities, including calling her a “worthless hooker.” Taking a pair of tinted glasses on and off to read the evidence, Mr. Depp sometimes appeared mildly perturbed as Mr. Rottenborn cut off his responses for time — at one point commenting, “Well, I don’t feel like I’m wasting anyone’s time, sir.” Ms. Heard’s lawyers are scheduled to continue cross-examining Mr. Depp on Monday.","lawyers amber heard thursday inconsistencies johnny depp testimony defamation trial married actors text messages depp audio recordings couple arguments ms heard asserted court papers depp repeatedly assaulted marriage including fight reeled head butted bashing nose depp testified struck ms heard relationship accused aggressor depp stand thursday vehemently disagreed head butted ms heard night restrain impossible bump confronted recording head butted forehead expletive doesn break nose depp placate ms heard repeating version events intentional head butt actor peaceful conversation ms heard placate bit trial fairfax county circuit court revolves op ed ms heard wrote washington post public figure representing domestic abuse trial testimony analysis ms heard wrote includes lengthy review physical altercations actors differing accounts extensive review depp drugs alcohol thursday lawyer ms heard ben rottenborn depp recall wrote bloody messages wall objects finger severed testimony depp affirmed written message mirror injured finger referred ms heard wife easy amber lampshade luck careful top advice depp replied disagree depp finger severed couple australia filming pirates caribbean movie depp testified ms heard threw handle vodka shattered hand severed finger court papers ms heard severed finger smashing phone smithereens amid bout physical violence ms heard countersuing depp defamation lawyer called accusations hoax written court papers depp drug alcohol central cycle abuse writing johnny volatile violent influence drugs alcohol contrite apologetic sober depp testified tuesday ms heard depiction drug alcohol grossly embellished addicted opioid successfully detoxed cross examination ms heard lawyer sought depp misrepresented drug rottenborn questioned depp incident actor account diverges ms heard written court papers depp drinking heavily private flight threw objects screamed obscenities kicked angry romantic scene filming actor james franco locked plane bathroom passed court papers depp testified wednesday opioids glass champagne flight adding locked bathroom ms heard actively searching instigate fight ms heard court papers struck depp defense defense sister courtroom defamation trial involving married actors johnny depp amber heard underway fairfax county circuit court virginia depp brought defamation ms heard effort domestic abuse allegations denies jury countersuit ms heard claims depp defamed lawyer domestic abuse claims hoax ms heard op ed depp suit filed response op ed ms heard wrote washington post public figure representing domestic abuse mention husband lawyers argued referring relationship marriage ms heard filed divorce pair married obtained temporary restraining actor accusing hitting withdrew claim january couple agreed $ million divorce settlement earlier defamation trial depp brought london sun newspaper called wife beater headline trial judge found overwhelming evidence assaulted ms heard repeatedly marriage domestic abuse claims trial ms heard accused husband assaulting dating detailed instances slapped head butted threw ground depp accused punching kicking throwing objects rottenborn sought suggest depp behavior volatile acknowledged confronting text message friend actor paul bettany reference flight text depp rattled exaggerated list drugs alcohol ingested left screaming obscenities insulting depp suggested response creativity speaks text messages write text impassioned canvas painting depp choose colors rottenborn questioned depp drugs prompting actor comment drew laughs courtroom marilyn manson pill stop talking cross examination depp confronted text messages referred ms heard insults obscenities including calling worthless hooker taking pair tinted glasses read evidence depp appeared mildly perturbed rottenborn cut responses time commenting don feel wasting time sir ms heard lawyers scheduled continue cross examining depp monday"
"Johnny Depp Flirts With Idea of Trump Assassination, Then Apologizes","LONDON — The actor Johnny Depp is the latest American entertainment figure to suggest — however jokingly, ironically or obliquely — the killing of President Trump. Speaking on Thursday at the Glastonbury arts festival in southwest England, Mr. Depp asked the audience, “Can you bring Trump here?” The remark was met with booing and jeering, and he continued: “You misunderstand completely. When was the last time an actor assassinated a president? I want to clarify: I’m not an actor. I lie for a living. However, it’s been awhile, and maybe it’s time.” The words — which were condemned by the White House on Friday, and which Mr. Depp apologized for — were being interpreted as an allusion to the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln by John Wilkes Booth, an actor, in 1865. Mr. Depp, who was introducing a screening of the 2004 film “The Libertine” — in which he played the womanizing poet John Wilmot, second earl of Rochester — acknowledged that his words would cause a storm. “By the way, this is going to be in the press and it’ll be horrible,” he said. “It’s just a question; I’m not insinuating anything.” Mr. Depp’s comments immediately drew rebukes, including from the White House. On Friday afternoon, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, invoked Mr. Depp and Kathy Griffin, the comedian who last month appeared with a fake decapitated head of the president, in responding to a question about a Shakespeare in the Park production of “Julius Caesar” that has drawn criticism from Republicans for depicting a Trump-like Caesar being assassinated. Mr. Spicer said he did not know if the president was aware of the play, but “whether it’s that or Johnny Depp’s comments,” there is a “troubling lack of outrage we’ve seen in some of these incidents.” “The president’s made it clear that we should denounce violence in all of its forms, and if we’re going to hold to that standard than we should agree that that standard should be universally applied,” Mr. Spicer said. On Friday, Mr. Depp apologized for his remarks in a statement to People magazine. “I apologize for the bad joke I attempted last night in poor taste about President Trump,” he said. “It did not come out as intended, and I intended no malice. I was only trying to amuse, not to harm anyone.” Critics had described the comments as particularly distasteful and dangerous given their timing. A gunman, believed to be upset about Mr. Trump’s election, opened fire last week at members of the Republican congressional baseball team in a Washington suburb. “Secret Service, we have video evidence of Johnny Depp threatening to assassinate President Trump. Please do something!” an account linked to Tennessee Republicans wrote on Twitter. Others suggested a boycott of Mr. Depp’s films, although supporters countered that the remarks had clearly been made in jest. Mr. Depp is not the first celebrity to come under fire for making violent allusions toward Mr. Trump, spurring a debate about where to draw the line regarding incitement, political commentary and art when it comes to a president who has shown no reluctance to antagonize opponents. The Public Theater in New York, which puts on Shakespeare in the Park, recently lost financial support and drew protests over the “Julius Caesar” production. In May, after Ms. Griffin posed with what appeared to be the bloodied and severed head of the president, Mr. Trump said the image had upset his family. There was outrage across the political spectrum, and CNN fired Ms. Griffin from her job as co-host of its New Year’s Eve program. “Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself,” the president wrote on Twitter. “My children, especially my 11 year old son, Barron, are having a hard time with this. Sick!” In January, the singer Madonna, speaking at the Women’s March on Washington, said that she’d “thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.” Mr. Trump himself has come under attack for remarks about physical harm against his political opponents. During the presidential campaign, he mused aloud about supporters of gun rights taking matters into their own hands if Hillary Clinton were to become president and appoint judges who supported tighter gun control regulations. The suggestion, however oblique, provoked strong objections, including from Bernice A. King, daughter of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who called Mr. Trump’s words “distasteful, disturbing, dangerous.” Mr. Depp, 54, is known for performances in films like “Pirates of the Caribbean” and “Edward Scissorhands,” and he has been nominated three times for an Academy Award. He has been in the headlines recently over his divorce from the actress Amber Heard and reports of financial difficulties.","london actor johnny depp american entertainment figure suggest jokingly ironically obliquely killing president trump speaking thursday glastonbury arts festival southwest england depp audience bring trump remark met booing jeering continued misunderstand completely time actor assassinated president clarify actor lie living awhile time words condemned white house friday depp apologized interpreted allusion assassination president abraham lincoln john wilkes booth actor depp introducing screening film libertine played womanizing poet john wilmot earl rochester acknowledged words storm press ll horrible question insinuating depp comments immediately drew rebukes including white house friday afternoon sean spicer white house press secretary invoked depp kathy griffin comedian month appeared fake decapitated head president responding question shakespeare park production julius caesar drawn criticism republicans depicting trump caesar assassinated spicer president aware play johnny depp comments troubling lack outrage ve incidents president denounce violence forms hold standard agree standard universally applied spicer friday depp apologized remarks statement people magazine apologize bad joke attempted night poor taste president trump intended intended malice amuse harm critics comments distasteful dangerous timing gunman believed upset trump election fire week republican congressional baseball team washington suburb secret service video evidence johnny depp threatening assassinate president trump account linked tennessee republicans wrote twitter suggested boycott depp films supporters countered remarks jest depp celebrity fire violent allusions trump spurring debate draw line incitement political commentary art president shown reluctance antagonize opponents public theater york shakespeare park recently lost financial support drew protests julius caesar production ms griffin posed appeared bloodied severed head president trump image upset family outrage political spectrum cnn fired ms griffin job host eve program kathy griffin ashamed president wrote twitter children son barron hard time sick january singer madonna speaking women march washington awful lot blowing white house trump attack remarks physical harm political opponents presidential campaign mused aloud supporters gun rights taking matters hands hillary clinton president appoint judges supported tighter gun control regulations suggestion oblique provoked strong objections including bernice king daughter rev dr martin luther king jr called trump words distasteful disturbing dangerous depp performances films pirates caribbean edward scissorhands nominated times academy award headlines recently divorce actress amber heard reports financial difficulties"
"Johnny Depp Lost $22.5 Million ‘Pirates’ Role After Op-Ed, Manager Says","Johnny Depp’s talent manager testified on Monday in the actor’s defamation trial that Mr. Depp lost a $22.5 million deal to star in a sixth “Pirates of the Caribbean” movie after his ex-wife, Amber Heard, published an op-ed in which she called herself a “public figure representing domestic abuse.” The exact timing of when Mr. Depp was cut from the “Pirates” franchise has become a pertinent question in the trial because Mr. Depp’s lawsuit against Ms. Heard claims that her op-ed, published by The Washington Post in December 2018, “devastated” his reputation and career. Although the op-ed does not mention Mr. Depp by name, he has argued that it clearly referred to their relationship. Ms. Heard has accused Mr. Depp of assaulting her repeatedly during their relationship, which Mr. Depp denies. At Fairfax County Circuit Court in Virginia, the talent manager, Jack Whigham, testified that the actor had a verbal agreement with Disney to reprise his role as Captain Jack Sparrow in a proposed sixth film, but that in early 2019, it became clear that Disney was “going in a different direction.” “After the op-ed, it was impossible to get him a studio film,” testified Mr. Whigham, who has represented Mr. Depp since 2016. Lawyers for Ms. Heard have argued that it was not the actress’s op-ed that undermined Mr. Depp’s career but rather his own actions that led to bad publicity, seeking to prove during cross-examination of Mr. Whigham that Mr. Depp had, in fact, lost the “Pirates” job before the article was published. Elaine Charlson Bredehoft, a lawyer for Ms. Heard, pointed to a previous deposition by Mr. Whigham in which he said that it had been the fall of 2018 — before the op-ed was published — when he came to understand that it was becoming unlikely that Mr. Depp would appear in the next “Pirates” movie. Mr. Whigham testified that around that time, Disney had not yet made a decision about whether Mr. Depp would appear in the movie and it was “trending badly,” but he and the film producer Jerry Bruckheimer were still seeking to convince the company to keep Mr. Depp in the franchise. “We had hope,” Mr. Whigham said, “and it became clear to me in early 2019 that it was over.” In the op-ed, Ms. Heard asserted that her own career had been affected by becoming a “public figure representing domestic abuse,” saying that she was dropped as the face of a fashion brand and a movie had recast her role. The idea for the op-ed came from the American Civil Liberties Union, and a communications department employee from the nonprofit organization drafted the article, according to earlier testimony from Terence Dougherty, general counsel for the A.C.L.U. Initially, the op-ed draft referenced Ms. Heard’s relationship with Mr. Depp directly. But those references were later edited out after back-and-forth between A.C.L.U. personnel and Ms. Heard’s lawyers about a nondisclosure agreement associated with the couple’s divorce, Mr. Dougherty testified. Aside from discussions about the op-ed on which Mr. Depp’s lawsuit is based, much of the trial has focused on diverging accounts of physical abuse in Ms. Heard and Mr. Depp’s relationship. Mr. Depp testified that he has never hit Ms. Heard and that she was the aggressor, accusing her of punching him in the face and kicking a bathroom door into his head. Ms. Heard, who has not yet testified in the trial, has said in court papers that she never hit Mr. Depp except in self-defense or in defense of her sister, and that Mr. Depp tended to perpetrate violence against her when he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol. On Monday, Ms. Heard’s lawyers sought to undermine Mr. Whigham’s claim that Mr. Depp had a formal deal for the sixth “Pirates” movie at all. “Do you have any explanation for why there exists nothing — no piece of paper — nothing suggesting that Mr. Depp ever had a deal with Disney for ‘Pirates 6’?” Ms. Bredehoft asked. Mr. Whigham said it was not unusual for an actor to have a verbal agreement for a movie that is later put into writing. Ms. Bredehoft also pointed to other possible precursors to Mr. Depp’s reputational decline other than the op-ed, citing a headline from The Sun newspaper in Britain that called Mr. Depp a “wife beater.” That article was published in April 2018, she pointed out, and Mr. Depp sued the newspaper for it in June 2018 — both months before Mr. Whigham’s recollection of Disney’s declining interest in Mr. Depp for “Pirates.” (Ms. Heard’s potential witness list includes Tina Newman, a Disney executive.) Ms. Heard’s legal team has referred repeatedly to the defamation trial in Britain that arose from that lawsuit. But it appears that the team has been restricted from mentioning the outcome of the case, in which a judge in London ruled against Mr. Depp and found that there was “overwhelming evidence” that he had assaulted Ms. Heard repeatedly during their marriage.","johnny depp talent manager testified monday actor defamation trial depp lost $ million deal star sixth pirates caribbean movie wife amber heard published op ed called public figure representing domestic abuse exact timing depp cut pirates franchise pertinent question trial depp lawsuit ms heard claims op ed published washington post december devastated reputation career op ed mention depp argued referred relationship ms heard accused depp assaulting repeatedly relationship depp denies fairfax county circuit court virginia talent manager jack whigham testified actor verbal agreement disney reprise role captain jack sparrow proposed sixth film disney direction op ed impossible studio film testified whigham represented depp lawyers ms heard argued actress op ed undermined depp career actions led bad publicity seeking prove cross examination whigham depp lost pirates job article published elaine charlson bredehoft lawyer ms heard previous deposition whigham fall op ed published understand depp pirates movie whigham testified time disney decision depp movie trending badly film producer jerry bruckheimer seeking convince company depp franchise hope whigham op ed ms heard asserted career affected public figure representing domestic abuse dropped fashion brand movie recast role idea op ed american civil liberties union communications department employee nonprofit organization drafted article earlier testimony terence dougherty counsel initially op ed draft referenced ms heard relationship depp directly references edited personnel ms heard lawyers nondisclosure agreement couple divorce dougherty testified discussions op ed depp lawsuit based trial focused diverging accounts physical abuse ms heard depp relationship depp testified hit ms heard aggressor accusing punching kicking bathroom door head ms heard testified trial court papers hit depp defense defense sister depp tended perpetrate violence influence drugs alcohol monday ms heard lawyers sought undermine whigham claim depp formal deal sixth pirates movie explanation exists piece paper suggesting depp deal disney pirates ms bredehoft whigham unusual actor verbal agreement movie writing ms bredehoft precursors depp reputational decline op ed citing headline sun newspaper britain called depp wife beater article published april depp sued newspaper june months whigham recollection disney declining depp pirates ms heard potential witness list includes tina newman disney executive ms heard legal team referred repeatedly defamation trial britain arose lawsuit appears team restricted mentioning outcome judge london ruled depp found overwhelming evidence assaulted ms heard repeatedly marriage"
"Johnny Depp vs. Amber Heard: What We Know","The defamation trial in Virginia between the actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, now several weeks into testimony, has become a fierce battleground over the truth about their relationship, with both sides accusing the other of repeated domestic abuse in what was an unquestionably tumultuous marriage. Before a seven-person jury in Fairfax County Circuit Court, lawyers have questioned witnesses about the events of what has been described as a whirlwind romance that started on a movie set and soured into a barrage of fights and physical confrontations — the details of which vary widely depending on the account. Mr. Depp, 58, sued Ms. Heard, 36, for defamation after she wrote an op-ed for The Washington Post referring to herself as a “public figure representing domestic abuse.” After more than a year of legal sparring, Ms. Heard then countersued Mr. Depp, alleging that he defamed her when his former lawyer released statements saying her allegations of abuse were a hoax. Many of the allegations being aired in the courtroom have already been heard in a British case — which Mr. Depp lost — in which the actor sued The Sun newspaper for printing a headline that called him a “wife beater.” The trial, which started with opening arguments on April 12, is expected to last a few more weeks. So far, the testimony has been from witnesses brought forward by Mr. Depp. Ms. Heard is expected to begin presenting her case later this week. Mr. Depp’s lawsuit, filed in 2019, revolves around the 2018 op-ed written by Ms. Heard titled, “I spoke up against sexual violence — and faced our culture’s wrath. That has to change.” The op-ed does not mention Mr. Depp by name, but in it, Ms. Heard wrote that two years before the article’s publication, she became a “public figure representing domestic abuse.” In 2016, Ms. Heard was granted a temporary restraining order after showing up to a California court with a bruised face, writing in an application for the order that Mr. Depp had thrown a phone at her face at close range. (The actor denies this.) In the application, Ms. Heard wrote that Mr. Depp had been verbally and physically abusive to her throughout their relationship, detailing a recent incident in which she said he grabbed her by the hair and violently shoved her to the ground. (Mr. Depp wrote in court papers that this was a lie and that she was the one who punched him in the face that night.) Mr. Depp’s lawsuit asserted that Ms. Heard’s abuse allegations were an “elaborate hoax” that cost the actor his career and reputation. “Mr. Depp brings this defamation action to clear his name,” the actor’s lawsuit said. The op-ed says that after she became a “public figure representing domestic abuse,” she started to experience a backlash to her career. “Friends and advisers told me I would never again work as an actress — that I would be blacklisted,” she wrote. “A movie I was attached to recast my role. I had just shot a two-year campaign as the face of a global fashion brand, and the company dropped me.” She wrote that she saw “in real time, how institutions protect men accused of abuse.” Ms. Heard was identified in the op-ed as an ambassador on women’s rights for the American Civil Liberties Union, and in court papers, Ms. Heard said the A.C.L.U. suggested that she write the article and submitted it. Although the trial has become a sprawling inquiry into the couple’s marriage, one of Ms. Heard’s lawyers, Ben Rottenborn, tried to impress upon the jury in open arguments the idea that, ultimately, the case rests on “one piece of paper” — this op-ed. The jury is simultaneously considering Ms. Heard’s countersuit against Mr. Depp, which was filed in 2020. Ms. Heard’s defamation claim is against Mr. Depp, but the statements it centers on came from his former lawyer, Adam Waldman, who told the British tabloid The Daily Mail that the actress’s allegations were an “abuse hoax.” Her lawsuit claims Mr. Depp has “authorized and conspired” with Mr. Waldman, who was acting on the actor’s behalf, to “attempt to destroy and defame Ms. Heard in the press.” (Mr. Waldman was not named as a defendant.) Mr. Depp testified that he had never struck Ms. Heard, or any other woman. Instead, he asserted that Ms. Heard was the aggressor in the relationship, engaging in angry tirades and “demeaning name-calling” that would often escalate into physical violence. “It could begin with a slap, it could begin with a shove, it could begin with throwing a TV remote at my head, throwing a glass of wine in my face,” Mr. Depp said. The actor gave his account of several confrontations at the center of the case, including an incident in 2015 when the couple was in Australia for the filming of the fifth “Pirates of the Caribbean” movie. Mr. Depp testified that Ms. Heard was angry about a meeting she had with a lawyer about a potential postnuptial agreement and threw a handle of vodka, which shattered onto his hand, seriously injuring his middle finger. “The tip of my finger had been severed and I was looking directly at my bone sticking out,” he testified. In the courtroom. A defamation trial involving the formerly married actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard is currently underway in Fairfax County Circuit Court in Virginia. Here is what to know about the case: The case. Mr. Depp brought a defamation case against Ms. Heard in an effort to clear his name from domestic abuse allegations that she has made against him and that he denies. The jury is also considering a countersuit from Ms. Heard, who claims that Mr. Depp defamed her when his former lawyer said her domestic abuse claims were a “hoax.” Ms. Heard’s op-ed. Mr. Depp’s suit was filed in response to an op-ed Ms. Heard wrote for The Washington Post in 2018 in which she described herself as a “public figure representing domestic abuse.” Though she did not mention her former husband’s name, he and his lawyers have argued that she was clearly referring to their relationship. The end of their marriage. Ms. Heard filed for divorce in 2017, just over a year after the pair had married. She also obtained a temporary restraining order against the actor after accusing him of hitting her. She later withdrew that claim, and in January 2017, the couple agreed to a $7 million divorce settlement. An earlier defamation case. The trial follows another case Mr. Depp brought in London in 2020 against The Sun newspaper, which called him a “wife beater” in a headline. In that trial, a judge found that there was “overwhelming evidence” that he had assaulted Ms. Heard repeatedly during their marriage. The domestic abuse claims. In the 2020 trial, Ms. Heard accused her former husband of assaulting her first in 2013, after they began dating, and detailed other instances in which he slapped her, head-butted her and threw her to the ground. Mr. Depp has since accused her of punching him, kicking him and throwing objects at him. During cross-examination, Mr. Rottenborn confronted him with text messages he sent to others in which he called Ms. Heard obscenities, including calling her a “worthless hooker.” Mr. Depp testified that he was ashamed about some of these text messages, suggesting that there was a certain level of creativity and exaggeration in the way he writes. “When I write a text, especially if I’m in a particularly impassioned place, it’s a canvas, it’s a painting,” Mr. Depp said. “You choose your colors.” Most notably, Ms. Heard. Based on one of her lawyers’ opening arguments, she is likely to give a very different account of the relationship, including what happened in Australia. The lawyer, Elaine Charlson Bredehoft, told the jury that Mr. Depp ripped off Ms. Heard’s nightgown and sexually assaulted her, and Ms. Heard has said in court papers that Mr. Depp injured his fingers while smashing a phone “into smithereens” as he hit her. (Mr. Depp testified that he never sexually assaulted Ms. Heard.) Ms. Heard’s lawyers have released an extensive potential witness list, which includes Elon Musk and James Franco. (Ms. Heard exchanged texts with Mr. Musk about her marriage that were used as evidence in the British case, and she said in that trial that Mr. Franco saw bruises on her face after an altercation that is in dispute.) Other potential witnesses include Mr. Waldman; Anthony Romero, the executive director of the A.C.L.U; and friends of Ms. Heard’s who were present for key incidents in the case. Mr. Depp’s lawyers have already brought forward several witnesses, including a sister who has acted as a personal manager, Christi Dembrowski; a physician, David Kipper, who said he treated the actor for opioid addiction; and the couple’s marriage counselor, Laurel Anderson, who said she saw “mutual abuse” in the relationship. Ben King, the property manager at an Australian home where the couple stayed during their 2015 trip, testified about the damage he witnessed in the home after that incident, describing broken glass, blood drippings and a collapsed Ping-Pong table — as well as how he found Mr. Depp’s fingertip in a “scrunched up” piece of paper amid the wreckage. The court also heard testimony from a forensic psychologist who had evaluated Ms. Heard; police officers who responded to a 911 call to Mr. Depp’s penthouse; and a former agent for both actors, Christian Carino, who said he believed Mr. Depp lost a role in a potential sixth “Pirates” movie because of the abuse accusations. Terence Dougherty, general counsel for the A.C.L.U, testified that an early draft of the op-ed, which was prepared by the A.C.L.U., referred directly to Ms. Heard and Mr. Depp’s relationship but that those references were edited out after conversations about the terms of a nondisclosure agreement related to their divorce. A judge found in 2020 that there was “overwhelming evidence” that Mr. Depp had assaulted Ms. Heard repeatedly during their marriage and that he had put her “in fear of her life.” There appear to have been some restrictions placed on reference to the British trial in Virginia, but those have not been disclosed to the public. Ms. Heard’s lawyers have been allowed to reference testimony from the case, including Mr. Depp’s.","defamation trial virginia actors johnny depp amber heard weeks testimony fierce battleground truth

"Johnny Depp, Accused of Spousal Abuse, Says Ex-Wife Was the Aggressor","The actor Johnny Depp took the stand for the second day on Wednesday to describe his turbulent marriage to the actress Amber Heard, whom he has sued for defamation, accusing her of “demeaning name-calling” that often escalated into physical violence. “It could begin with a slap, it could begin with a shove, it could begin with throwing a TV remote at my head, throwing a glass of wine in my face,” Mr. Depp told a jury at Fairfax County Circuit Court in Virginia. Ms. Heard has accused Mr. Depp in court papers of repeatedly assaulting her throughout their relationship, from slapping and kicking to dragging her across the floor by her hair and grasping her throat, making her fearful that he would kill her. But over the past few years of legal wrangling in the United States and Britain, Mr. Depp has maintained that Ms. Heard was the one who was violent toward him. In testimony on Tuesday, Mr. Depp denied ever striking Ms. Heard or any woman. “She has a need for conflict, she has a need for violence,” he said of Ms. Heard. “It erupts out of nowhere.” Ms. Heard denied in court papers that she had ever struck Mr. Depp except in self-defense or in defense of her sister. Mr. Depp has sued Ms. Heard for defamation over an op-ed she wrote in 2018 in which she said she was a <U+200B><U+200B>“public figure representing domestic abuse.” The article did not mention Mr. Depp’s name, but he testified that the time-frame reference in the op-ed was clearly in reference to their marriage, which lasted less than two years. The seven-person jury will also consider Ms. Heard’s countersuit, which asserts that Mr. Depp defamed her when his former lawyer made statements saying that her allegations of domestic abuse were a hoax. During more than five hours of testimony on Wednesday, the jury heard snippets of recorded arguments between the couple. Those included audio of Mr. Depp confronting Ms. Heard about kicking a door into his head the previous night and Ms. Heard asking, “Why are you obsessing over the fact that I can’t remember it the way you remember it?” During his testimony, Mr. Depp strove to present his side of several incidents that have surfaced as their problems in their relationship became public, including the time Mr. Depp’s middle finger was severed. The injury occurred in 2015 while the couple was in Australia for the filming of the fifth “Pirates of the Caribbean” movie. Mr. Depp told the jury that, at the time, Ms. Heard was angry about a meeting she had with a lawyer about a potential postnuptial agreement and threw two vodka bottles at him, one of which missed while another shattered into his hand, causing his finger to bleed “like Vesuvius.” He testified that he then experienced a “nervous breakdown” and used his bloody finger to write on the walls messages that “represented lies that she told me.” Ms. Heard, who is expected to take the stand later in the trial, has given a very different account of the incident in Australia, writing in court papers that Mr. Depp became violent with her during an argument about his drug use. She has said that at one point he grabbed her by the neck and collarbone and slammed her into a countertop, then hit her with the back of his hand and slammed a phone against a wall until it “smashed into smithereens,” injuring his finger. Upon her return to Los Angeles, Ms. Heard wrote in court papers that “I had a busted lip, a swollen nose and cuts all over my body.” In the courtroom. A defamation trial involving the formerly married actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard is currently underway in Fairfax County Circuit Court in Virginia. Here is what to know about the case: The case. Mr. Depp brought a defamation case against Ms. Heard in an effort to clear his name from domestic abuse allegations that she has made against him and that he denies.

Mr. Depp has since accused her of punching him, kicking him and throwing objects at him. In 2016, Ms. Heard was granted a temporary restraining order against Mr. Depp after telling a court in California that Mr. Depp had thrown a phone at her face at close range, bruising it. (Mr. Depp testified that he “flopped” the phone onto the couch and has asserted in court papers that Ms. Heard’s facial marks were of her own doing.) Many of the accusations being lobbed back and forth in Virginia have already been aired in a court in London. After Mr. Depp sued The Sun newspaper there for a headline in which they referred to him as a “wife beater,” citing “overwhelming evidence” during their marriage, a British judge ruled against the actor. In Fairfax County, Judge Penney S. Azcarate appeared to cut off an attempt by one of Ms. Heard’s lawyers to mention the British case earlier in the trial. After a sidebar with the judge, the lawyer moved onto a new line of questioning, indicating that there have been restrictions put on any reference to those proceedings. Mr. Depp will continue on the stand on Thursday when he is to be cross-examined by a lawyer for Ms. Heard. Mr. Depp’s suit argues that his career has suffered because of Ms. Heard’s depiction of him. On Wednesday, Mr. Depp testified that as Ms. Heard’s abuse allegations “gained momentum around the world,” calls stopped coming from agents and producers and he felt as though people started to look at him differently. “No matter the outcome of this trial, I will carry that for the rest of my days,” he said.","actor johnny depp stand day wednesday describe turbulent marriage actress amber heard sued defamation accusing demeaning calling escalated physical violence begin slap begin shove begin throwing tv remote head throwing glass wine depp told jury fairfax county circuit court virginia ms heard accused depp court papers repeatedly assaulting relationship slapping kicking dragging floor hair grasping throat fearful kill past legal wrangling united britain depp maintained ms heard violent testimony tuesday depp denied striking ms heard woman conflict violence ms heard erupts ms heard denied court papers struck depp defense defense sister depp sued ms heard defamation op ed wrote <U+200B><U+200B>public figure representing domestic abuse article mention depp testified time frame reference op ed reference marriage lasted person jury ms heard countersuit asserts depp defamed lawyer statements allegations domestic abuse hoax hours testimony wednesday jury heard snippets recorded arguments couple included audio depp confronting ms heard kicking door head previous night ms heard obsessing remember remember testimony depp strove incidents surfaced relationship public including time depp middle finger severed injury occurred couple australia filming pirates caribbean movie depp told jury time ms heard angry meeting lawyer potential postnuptial agreement threw vodka bottles missed shattered hand causing finger bleed vesuvius testified experienced nervous breakdown bloody finger write walls messages represented lies told ms heard expected stand trial account incident australia writing court papers depp violent argument drug grabbed neck collarbone slammed countertop hit hand slammed phone wall smashed smithereens injuring finger return los angeles ms heard wrote court papers busted lip swollen nose cuts body courtroom defamation trial involving married actors johnny depp amber heard underway fairfax county circuit court virginia depp brought defamation ms heard effort domestic abuse allegations denies jury countersuit ms heard claims depp defamed lawyer domestic abuse claims hoax ms heard op ed depp suit filed response op ed ms heard wrote washington post public figure representing domestic abuse mention husband lawyers argued referring relationship marriage ms heard filed divorce pair married obtained temporary restraining actor accusing hitting withdrew claim january couple agreed $ million divorce settlement earlier defamation trial depp brought london sun newspaper called wife beater headline trial judge found overwhelming evidence assaulted ms heard repeatedly marriage domestic abuse claims trial ms heard accused husband assaulting dating detailed instances slapped head butted threw ground depp accused punching kicking throwing objects ms heard granted temporary restraining depp telling court california depp thrown phone close range bruising depp testified flopped phone couch asserted court papers ms heard facial marks accusations lobbed virginia aired court london depp sued sun newspaper headline referred wife beater citing overwhelming evidence marriage british judge ruled actor fairfax county judge penney azcarate appeared cut attempt ms heard lawyers mention british earlier trial sidebar judge lawyer moved line questioning indicating restrictions reference proceedings depp continue stand thursday cross examined lawyer ms heard depp suit argues career suffered ms heard depiction wednesday depp testified ms heard abuse allegations gained momentum world calls stopped coming agents producers people started matter outcome trial carry rest days"

But Mr. Depp told a seven-person jury sitting in Fairfax County Circuit Court in Virginia that it came as a “complete shock” when she lodged those accusations publicly. “Never did I myself reach the point of striking Ms. Heard in any way,” the actor testified, “nor have I ever struck any woman in my life.” Speaking slowly and carefully, Mr. Depp described how the allegations sent his reputation and career, characterized by flashy roles in “Pirates of the Caribbean” and “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,” in decline. “It’s very strange when one day you’re Cinderella, so to speak, and then in 0.6 seconds you’re Quasimodo,” he said. “And I didn’t deserve that.” The testimony came on the fifth day of the trial over whether Ms. Heard, 35, defamed her former husband, Mr. Depp, 58, when she wrote an op-ed for The Washington Post in 2018. In it, she said her career had been harmed after she became a “public figure representing domestic abuse.” Mr. Depp’s name was not mentioned in the op-ed, but he and his lawyers have argued that she was clearly referring to their relationship, which ended in divorce in 2017. Mr. Depp’s lawsuit claimed that Ms. Heard’s op-ed “devastated” his once flourishing acting career. The jury is also considering a countersuit from Ms. Heard, who claims that Mr. Depp defamed her when his former lawyer made statements saying Ms. Heard’s domestic abuse claims were an orchestrated “hoax.” In court papers, Mr. Depp has alleged that Ms. Heard physically abused him throughout their relationship, including by throwing objects at him. He said those objects included a vodka bottle that shattered on the counter near him and severed one of his fingers — an account that has become a key anecdote in the trial. Ms. Heard has denied in court papers that she was ever physically violent toward Mr. Depp, except in self-defense or in defense of her sister. She has said Mr. Depp hurt his finger while smashing a phone against a wall repeatedly. On Tuesday, Mr. Depp provided an account not unlike the one he gave in London two years ago in an earlier defamation case he brought against The Sun newspaper for calling him a “wife beater” in a headline. In that trial, a judge found that there was “overwhelming evidence” that he had assaulted Ms. Heard repeatedly during their marriage and that he had put her “in fear of her life.” During their opening arguments last week, Ms. Heard’s lawyers told the jury that they would be presenting evidence of “graphic and horrifying” abuse against Ms. Heard, including instances of sexual assault, which Mr. Depp denies. One of her lawyers, Ben Rottenborn, questioned whether Mr. Depp’s accounts of events were credible if he was “blacked out” on drugs and alcohol, and he argued that Mr. Depp was responsible for the decline of his career, not Ms. Heard. In the courtroom. A defamation trial involving the formerly married actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard is currently underway in Fairfax County Circuit Court in Virginia. Here is what to know about the case: The case. Mr. Depp brought a defamation case against Ms. Heard in an effort to clear his name from domestic abuse allegations that she has made against him and that he denies. The jury is also considering a countersuit from Ms. Heard, who claims that Mr. Depp defamed her when his former lawyer said her domestic abuse claims were a “hoax.” Ms. Heard’s op-ed. Mr. Depp’s suit was filed in response to an op-ed Ms. Heard wrote for The Washington Post in 2018 in which she described herself as a “public figure representing domestic abuse.” Though she did not mention her former husband’s name, he and his lawyers have argued that she was clearly referring to their relationship. The end of their marriage. Ms. Heard filed for divorce in 2017, just over a year after the pair had married. She also obtained a temporary restraining order against the actor after accusing him of hitting her. She later withdrew that claim, and in January 2017, the couple agreed to a $7 million divorce settlement. An earlier defamation case. The trial follows another case Mr. Depp brought in London in 2020 against The Sun newspaper, which called him a “wife beater” in a headline. In that trial, a judge found that there was “overwhelming evidence” that he had assaulted Ms. Heard repeatedly during their marriage. The domestic abuse claims. In the 2020 trial, Ms. Heard accused her former husband of assaulting her first in 2013, after they began dating, and detailed other instances in which he slapped her, head-butted her and threw her to the ground. Mr. Depp has since accused her of punching him, kicking him and throwing objects at him. “This man’s poor choices have brought him to this courtroom,” Mr. Rottenborn said. Ms. Heard has said Mr. Depp’s violence often occurred when he was using drugs and alcohol. But Mr. Depp testified Tuesday that, while he had taken his first illicit drug as an 11-year-old dealing with an abusive mother, the account Ms. Heard has put forward about his drug use was “grossly embellished.” He said he had become addicted to Roxicodone, an opioid, when he was prescribed it following an injury on the set of the fourth “Pirates of the Caribbean” movie, but that he had detoxed from that drug during their relationship. “I am not some maniac who needs to be high or loaded all the time,” he said, adding that Ms. Heard’s friends, in fact, marveled at how little effect drugs and alcohol had on him. Mr. Depp’s lawyers have argued that Ms. Heard has been “living and breathing this lie” surrounding domestic abuse for years and that the actor’s drug and alcohol use did not make him an abuser. “Mr. Depp, like all of us, is not perfect, but he’s not an abuser,” said Camille Vasquez, one of the actor’s lawyers, last week. In prior days, the jury and four alternates have heard live testimony or recordings of video depositions from several witnesses called by Mr. Depp’s lawyers, including a sister who has acted as a personal manager, Christi Dembrowski; a physician, Dr. David Kipper, who said he treated the actor for opioid addiction; and the couple’s marriage counselor, Laurel Anderson, who said she saw “mutual abuse” in the relationship. Participants have said they expect the trial to last about six weeks, and Ms. Heard is also expected to testify. Mr. Depp’s testimony will continue on Wednesday.","actor johnny depp stand tuesday defamation brought actress amber heard wife seeking domestic abuse allegations based species truth ms heard accused depp court papers abusing repeatedly relationship including slapping kicking headbutting dragging hair depp told person jury sitting fairfax county circuit court virginia complete shock lodged accusations publicly reach striking ms heard actor testified struck woman life speaking slowly carefully depp allegations reputation career characterized flashy roles pirates caribbean charlie chocolate factory decline strange day cinderella speak quasimodo didn deserve testimony day trial ms heard defamed husband depp wrote op ed washington post career harmed public figure representing domestic abuse depp mentioned op ed lawyers argued referring relationship divorce depp lawsuit claimed ms heard op ed devastated flourishing acting career jury countersuit ms heard claims depp defamed lawyer statements ms heard domestic abuse claims orchestrated hoax court papers depp alleged ms heard physically abused relationship including throwing objects objects included vodka bottle shattered counter severed fingers account key anecdote trial ms heard denied court papers physically violent depp defense defense sister depp hurt finger smashing phone wall repeatedly tuesday depp provided account unlike london ago earlier defamation brought sun newspaper calling wife beater headline trial judge found overwhelming evidence assaulted ms heard repeatedly marriage fear life arguments week ms heard lawyers told jury evidence graphic horrifying abuse ms heard including instances sexual assault depp denies lawyers ben rottenborn questioned depp accounts events credible blacked drugs alcohol argued depp responsible decline career ms heard courtroom defamation trial involving married actors johnny depp amber heard underway fairfax county circuit court virginia depp brought defamation ms heard effort domestic abuse allegations denies jury countersuit ms heard claims depp defamed lawyer domestic abuse claims hoax ms heard op ed depp suit filed response op ed ms heard wrote washington post public figure representing domestic abuse mention husband lawyers argued referring relationship marriage ms heard filed divorce pair married obtained temporary restraining actor accusing hitting withdrew claim january couple agreed $ million divorce settlement earlier defamation trial depp brought london sun newspaper called wife beater headline trial judge found overwhelming evidence assaulted ms heard repeatedly marriage domestic abuse claims trial ms heard accused husband assaulting dating detailed instances slapped head butted threw ground depp accused punching kicking throwing objects poor choices brought courtroom rottenborn ms heard depp violence occurred drugs alcohol depp testified tuesday illicit drug dealing abusive mother account ms heard forward drug grossly embellished addicted roxicodone opioid prescribed injury set fourth pirates caribbean movie detoxed drug relationship maniac loaded time adding ms heard friends marveled effect drugs alcohol depp lawyers argued ms heard living breathing lie surrounding domestic abuse actor drug alcohol abuser depp perfect abuser camille vasquez actor lawyers week prior days jury alternates heard live testimony recordings video depositions witnesses called depp lawyers including sister acted personal manager christi dembrowski physician dr david kipper treated actor opioid addiction couple marriage counselor laurel anderson mutual abuse relationship participants expect trial weeks ms heard expected testify depp testimony continue wednesday"
"Johnny Depp’s Dogs Face Deportation or Death in Australia","Capt. Jack Sparrow has outsmarted Hector Barbossa, Davy Jones, Blackbeard and Lord Cutler Beckett. But he may have met his match with Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce of Australia. Mr. Joyce declared that no one is above the law, not even Johnny Depp, the Hollywood star who plays Captain Sparrow in the “Pirates of the Caribbean” series and who has twice been named People magazine’s “Sexiest Man Alive.” Mr. Joyce said Thursday that Mr. Depp had two days to deport his two Yorkshire terriers, Pistol and Boo, or they would be put to death. Mr. Depp, 51, who is filming the fifth installment of the series in Australia, had imported the dogs illegally by bypassing strict documenting and quarantine rules, Mr. Joyce said. “It basically looks like he snuck them in,” Mr. Joyce told reporters in Canberra. “Mr. Depp either has to take his dogs back to California or we’re going to have to euthanize them.” Mr. Joyce’s ultimatum created a minor social media sensation, with dog lovers and fans of Mr. Depp starting a Twitter hashtag #WarOnTerrier. Several thousand people signed an online petition beseeching Mr. Joyce to have mercy on the Yorkies. One Internet posting is a countdown to Mr. Joyce’s deadline with the advisory: “It’s almost time to kill Johnny Depp’s dogs.” “If you start letting movie stars — even though they’ve been the sexiest man alive twice — to come into our nation, then why don’t we just break the laws for everybody?” Mr. Joyce said. By Friday morning, arrangements had been made for the dogs to fly back to the United States. “The owners of the dogs have agreed to send the dogs back to the United States and it is expected that this evening, a Department of Agriculture vet will pick up the dogs and take them in a special crate to the airport for the trip home,” Mr. Joyce’s press secretary, Gerard McManus, said in a telephone interview. It was not known if Mr. Depp or his wife, Amber Heard, would accompany the dogs home. The veterinarian accompanying Pistol and Boo would ensure they do not come into contact with other animals, Mr. McManus added. As the world’s largest exporter of sheep, Australia enforces stringent regulations on imported animals to minimize the spread of infectious diseases. The Department of Agriculture’s 19-step guide for a valid import permit for dogs requires weeks of preparation, and the animals must be quarantined for 10 days. Under the rules, “if an animal arrives in Australia and it does not meet all of the conditions of the accompanying import permit, then it may be returned to the country of export or euthanized at the importer’s expense.” The filming of the latest Captain Sparrow adventure, “Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,” first began shooting in February, but was suspended after a month when Mr. Depp suffered a hand injury. He then flew to the United States for treatment, and brought the dogs back with him on his private jet. It was not clear precisely how or when the authorities discovered Mr. Depp’s dogs were in the country. But Mr. Joyce said he learned about them after they were spotted and photographed at the “Happy Dogz” grooming salon on Australia’s Gold Coast, where the film is being shot.","capt jack sparrow outsmarted hector barbossa davy jones blackbeard lord cutler beckett met match agriculture minister barnaby joyce australia joyce declared law johnny depp hollywood star plays captain sparrow pirates caribbean series named people magazine sexiest alive joyce thursday depp days deport yorkshire terriers pistol boo death depp filming installment series australia imported dogs illegally bypassing strict documenting quarantine rules joyce basically snuck joyce told reporters canberra depp dogs california euthanize joyce ultimatum created minor social media sensation dog lovers fans depp starting twitter hashtag waronterrier thousand people signed online petition beseeching joyce mercy yorkies internet posting countdown joyce deadline advisory time kill johnny depp dogs start letting movie stars ve sexiest alive nation don break laws joyce friday morning arrangements dogs fly united owners dogs agreed send dogs united expected evening department agriculture vet pick dogs special crate airport trip home joyce press secretary gerard mcmanus telephone interview depp wife amber heard accompany dogs home veterinarian accompanying pistol boo ensure contact animals mcmanus added world largest exporter sheep australia enforces stringent regulations imported animals minimize spread infectious diseases department agriculture step guide valid import permit dogs requires weeks preparation animals quarantined days rules animal arrives australia meet conditions accompanying import permit returned country export euthanized importer expense filming captain sparrow adventure pirates caribbean dead tales shooting february suspended month depp suffered hand injury flew united treatment brought dogs private jet precisely authorities discovered depp dogs country joyce learned spotted photographed happy dogz grooming salon australia gold coast film shot"
"Jude Law Comes Out as the Young Dumbledore","Even Jude Law gets nervous — especially when he has just been cast as Albus Dumbledore in “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald” and he’s meeting J.K. Rowling. “She makes a great effort to make you feel at ease when you know you’re in the presence of someone pretty extraordinary,” he said of the “Harry Potter” and “Fantastic Beasts” author. She also never sat down as they peeled back the layers of Dumbledore — the consummate wizard and eventual Hogwarts headmaster, the character Rowling has said often speaks for her — walking and talking as if compelled by some strange force for nearly two and a half hours. In sky-high heels. “It was like a purge, it was like a confession, it was like she was alive in it,” Law said, laughing. As Dumbledore in his younger years, Law is shouldering the weight of a literary role brought to life by Richard Harris and Michael Gambon in the “Harry Potter” movies. He’s also revealing a defining moment for Dumbledore: a romantic liaison with his dark counterpart, Gellert Grindelwald, played by Johnny Depp. [Read our review of “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.”] Although Rowling outed Dumbledore to fans in 2007, the Harry Potter books and movies were mute about his sexuality. Earlier this year, the director David Yates ignited a furor when he said that Dumbledore would not be “explicitly” gay in this second of the franchise’s five planned films. “He didn’t say that to me,” Law said. “Every time I asked, it was, ‘Yes, he is.’ In my mind, he is.” (Yates later said he had shot a couple of “very sensual” scenes.) Next month, Law will portray the sleazoid manager of a pop star (Natalie Portman) in “Vox Lux.” In March, he’s suiting up — but keeping mum about it in the meantime — as Walter Lawson, the mentor to Brie Larson’s titular superhero in “Captain Marvel.” And he’ll soon start shooting HBO’s “The New Pope,” the sequel to “The Young Pope,” in which he played the first American pontiff. On a rainy New York morning, sipping hot water with lemon at the St. Regis, the London-based Law chatted about stepping into Dumbledore’s slippers, Depp’s future with “Fantastic Beasts” and the mixed blessing of his own good looks. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. So, Dumbledore. Did they have you in mind for the role from the beginning? No, I don’t believe so. I knew they were looking to bring this character back. And so I put myself forward and, quite rightly, they took it very seriously. They wanted to make sure they got the right person, and I went in and willingly played around in front of a camera so they could have a look at me. I wanted to audition the part just like they wanted to audition me — to get a sense of, “Can I do this beloved role to millions?” What insight did J.K. Rowling offer? She took me back through his childhood and how that emotion impacted this young man. One of the key relationships we talked about, of course, was with Gellert Grindelwald, and how that was formative in that it was intense, intimate, passionate. It was the first time Dumbledore met his match and, for a reason I can’t divulge, they have this falling out. And it propels them in opposite directions and leaves this wound between them that is still open some 25 years later. And what did David Yates mean by Dumbledore not being “explicitly” gay? Put it this way: This film is not about his homosexuality, nor does his sexuality define him. But that relationship is certainly a defining element of who he is and what he’s about. I also don’t think he’s someone who has given his heart or his soul to many people. The aftermath of their relationship left him reeling, and he’s packed his heart in ice, to be honest, and no one’s quite thawed it. Is the world ready for a gay children’s icon? I think the world is ready for it, and if it isn’t, it bloody well should be. Is Johnny Depp going to be in the next film? [Amber Heard, Depp’s ex-wife, accused him of physical abuse, an accusation he denies.] I believe so. Is there going to be a romance? I have no idea. In Brady Corbet’s “Vox Lux,” you’re the grubby manager of Celeste, a school-shooting survivor turned pop star. I had seen Brady’s first film, “The Childhood of a Leader,” and I was so impressed by the ambition and boldness. So he sent me the script. To me, it’s like the wicked sister to “A Star Is Born.” By the end, you realize that the two of them survived it together, and it’s strange who’s the junkie and who’s the dealer. Celeste reminded me of the Parkland, Fla., students who were simultaneously celebrated and vilified. It takes something that unfortunately is becoming a monthly occurrence and uses it as a starting point for a journey into our relationship with media, with celebrity, with music, with culture. You follow a survivor and the idea that surviving — or the celebrity that is put on her — is a curse. I would like to think that the victims of these awful scenarios would say, “Thank God someone is actually shining a light on it.” Your Woody Allen project, “A Rainy Day in New York,” has been shelved by Amazon amid the #MeToo movement. What’s it like having your work collect dust? It’s a terrible shame. I’d love to see it. People worked really hard and put a lot in, obviously himself included. After child molestation allegations against Allen by his daughter Dylan Farrow resurfaced, some of the cast members distanced themselves from him by donating their salaries or saying they’d never work with him again. You didn’t. [Allen has denied the accusations.] I didn’t really want to get involved, to be honest. I just don’t feel like it was my place to comment, and it’s too delicate a situation. I feel like enough has been said about it. It’s a private affair. [As for working with Allen again], I don’t know. I’d have to consider carefully. Has #MeToo prompted you to rethink the roles you choose? You always have to look at the impact a part is going to have and how a part is handled. We had an interesting conversation about this on “The Nest” [a forthcoming psychodrama about a businessman and his family] because of the way my character and others around him treated the women in the office. It was set in 1986, and people were discussing, “Do we slap them on the ass or use derogatory terms?” And I was like, “Wait a minute, we’re not in the ’80s. We’re making this film now. So yeah, you can include that if you make a point in saying, ‘We were wrong.’ But if you’re not, then there’s no point in just continuing the myth.” Many articles have been written about your beauty. Is it a blessing or a curse? Getting pigeonholed as an actor is terrifying because you want to keep people guessing. So being the golden boy or the beautiful young thing clearly worries me because you think, What happens when my hair falls out, like it is, and I start getting old? The good news is I certainly felt like turning 40, I saw more opportunity to play against type or out of my comfort zone. Looks is a funny thing, isn’t it? I don’t know — I just feel like there’s so much more to talk about. Having said that, I’m 45. If people say, “You’re desperately good looking,” then I’ll say, “I’m desperately happy to hear that.”","jude law nervous cast albus dumbledore fantastic beasts crimes grindelwald meeting rowling makes effort feel ease presence pretty extraordinary harry potter fantastic beasts author sat peeled layers dumbledore consummate wizard eventual hogwarts headmaster character rowling speaks walking talking compelled strange force half hours sky heels purge confession alive law laughing dumbledore law shouldering weight literary role brought life richard harris michael gambon harry potter movies revealing defining moment dumbledore romantic liaison dark counterpart gellert grindelwald played johnny depp read review fantastic beasts crimes grindelwald rowling outed dumbledore fans harry potter books movies mute sexuality earlier director david yates ignited furor dumbledore explicitly gay franchise planned films didn law time mind yates shot couple sensual scenes month law portray sleazoid manager pop star natalie portman vox lux march suiting keeping mum meantime walter lawson mentor brie larson titular superhero captain marvel ll start shooting hbo pope sequel pope played american pontiff rainy york morning sipping hot water lemon st regis london based law chatted stepping dumbledore slippers depp future fantastic beasts mixed blessing edited excerpts conversation dumbledore mind role beginning don bring character forward rightly person willingly played front camera audition audition sense beloved role millions insight rowling offer childhood emotion impacted key relationships talked gellert grindelwald formative intense intimate passionate time dumbledore met match reason divulge falling propels opposite directions leaves wound david yates dumbledore explicitly gay film homosexuality sexuality define relationship defining element don heart soul people aftermath relationship left reeling packed heart ice honest thawed world ready gay children icon world ready isn bloody johnny depp film amber heard depp wife accused physical abuse accusation denies romance idea brady corbet vox lux grubby manager celeste school shooting survivor pop star brady film childhood leader impressed ambition boldness script wicked sister star born realize survived strange junkie dealer celeste reminded parkland fla students simultaneously celebrated vilified takes monthly occurrence starting journey relationship media celebrity music culture follow survivor idea surviving celebrity curse victims awful scenarios god shining light woody allen project rainy day york shelved amazon amid metoo movement collect dust terrible shame love people hard lot included child molestation allegations allen daughter dylan farrow resurfaced cast distanced donating salaries didn allen denied accusations didn involved honest don feel comment delicate situation feel private affair allen don carefully metoo prompted rethink roles choose impact handled conversation nest forthcoming psychodrama businessman family character treated women office set people discussing slap ass derogatory terms wait minute s film yeah include wrong continuing myth articles written beauty blessing curse pigeonholed actor terrifying people guessing golden boy beautiful worries hair falls start news opportunity play type comfort zone funny isn don feel talk people desperately ll desperately happy hear"
"London Fashion Week Partygoers Tear Up Dance Floor (and Tear Down a Wall)","LONDON — “Where is your passport? I want your documentation now,” demanded a thickset uniformed soldier with a heavy German accent, sitting on a velvet pouf in a shadowy subterranean nightclub. On the left, a pack of scowling punks in leathers leaned against a graffitied concrete wall. To the right, hordes of beautiful women in glitter and shoulder pads lounged, sipping cups of Champagne. “Your passport, Fräulein,” the Stasi soldier said again. Getting into parties during fashion week is often tough, but this took the experience to new extremes. Presumably, that was the point, at least as envisioned by Love magazine editors and Marc Jacobs, the party hosts who chose 1989 Berlin — just before the wall came down — as the theme for London Fashion Week’s biggest bash, held Monday night at Loulou’s, a members-only club in Mayfair. After navigating the crowds of paparazzi outside, guests descended a rickety staircase before being sent either east or west of a giant model Berlin Wall that divided the cavernous dance floor in two. On one side, a clutch of starry attendees including Bella Hadid and Winnie Harlow, the makeup artist Charlotte Tilbury, the photographer Mert Alas and Mr. Jacobs, alongside the party co-hosts Katie Grand and Poppy Delevingne, nibbled on halibut, red cabbage and potato salad behind velvet ropes. On the other, hordes of models, designers and industry hangers-on sipped Moscow Mules whipped up by red-waistcoated, handlebar-mustachioed waiters at a Checkpoint Charlie bar (only if you had the right papers, of course). The club was heaving. The music was deafening. People were letting very loose. “It’s just blowing my mind — this level of insanity is exactly what a fashion week should be,” said the young British designer Matty Bovan, fresh from his well-received catwalk show on Saturday, who later took to the DJ decks with a friend and fellow designer, Charles Jeffrey. Mr. Bovan was clad in his signature New Romantic wares, squished between the photographer Ellen von Unwerth — and his mother. “I owe everything to her, she has been so endlessly supportive of me, of course I was going to bring her along,” he said. Mr. Bovan was not the only one to have a parent as a party accessory. Anna Cleveland, the model daughter of the model superstar Pat Cleveland, had brought along her father, Paul van Ravenstein. Frances Bean Cobain spoke intensely with her mother, the singer Courtney Love (both wearing Marc Jacobs). Then the neon lights flashed and the music was replaced by scratchy recordings of speeches, culminating in the one in 1987 in which President Reagan demanded that Mikhail Gorbachev, leader of the then-Soviet Union, “tear down this wall.” The 21st-century party gods heard, and down came the wall, opening up the dance floor. Cara Delevingne and Clara Paget, fresh from the Burberry show, huddled in one corner with Amber Heard, Johnny Depp’s ex-wife. Kate Moss, framed by her sister, Lottie, and her beau, Count Nikolai von Bismarck, sat in another. And Princess Beatrice, who was to host a breakfast for the fashion industry at Buckingham Palace bright and early Tuesday morning, held court in a third. There was no sign of Madonna, the latest Love cover star. But her 16-year-old son, Rocco Ritchie, was there, only to be bundled out of the club at 11 p.m. It was a school night, after all.","london passport documentation demanded thickset uniformed soldier heavy german accent sitting velvet pouf shadowy subterranean nightclub left pack scowling punks leathers leaned graffitied concrete wall hordes beautiful women glitter shoulder pads lounged sipping cups champagne passport fräulein stasi soldier parties fashion week tough experience extremes envisioned love magazine editors marc jacobs party hosts chose berlin wall theme london fashion week biggest bash held monday night loulou club mayfair navigating crowds paparazzi guests descended rickety staircase east west giant model berlin wall divided cavernous dance floor clutch starry attendees including bella hadid winnie harlow makeup artist charlotte tilbury photographer mert alas jacobs alongside party hosts katie grand poppy delevingne nibbled halibut red cabbage potato salad velvet ropes hordes models designers industry hangers sipped moscow mules whipped red waistcoated handlebar mustachioed waiters checkpoint charlie bar papers club heaving music deafening people letting loose blowing mind level insanity fashion week british designer matty bovan fresh received catwalk saturday dj decks friend fellow designer charles jeffrey bovan clad signature romantic wares squished photographer ellen von unwerth mother owe endlessly supportive bring bovan parent party accessory anna cleveland model daughter model superstar pat cleveland brought father paul van ravenstein frances bean cobain spoke intensely mother singer courtney love wearing marc jacobs neon lights flashed music replaced scratchy recordings speeches culminating president reagan demanded mikhail gorbachev leader soviet union tear wall st century party gods heard wall dance floor cara delevingne clara paget fresh burberry huddled corner amber heard johnny depp wife kate moss framed sister lottie beau count nikolai von bismarck sat princess beatrice host breakfast fashion industry buckingham palace bright tuesday morning held court sign madonna love cover star son rocco ritchie bundled club school night"

Let us know what you would like to see in these roundups by emailing us at popculture@nytimes.com. Tell us the good, the bad and the silly. • Bill Cosby is going to prison. The entertainer has been sentenced to three to 10 years for drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand in 2004. And he will go straight into custody as the judge denied him a request to remain free on bail while he pursues an anticipated appeal. You can follow our updates here. • Billy McFarland, the founder of the canceled Fyre Festival (sad sandwich meme forever), is claiming mental illness as the reason he defrauded investors and scammed customers. He could face more than 10 years in prison. [Billboard] • In depressingly predictable news, Mel Gibson, the director of “The Passion of the Christ,” is remaking the 1969 western “The Wild Bunch,” which at the time of its release was considered one of the most violent movies ever made. (Side note: Gibson was the inspiration for the satirical look at how men are forgiven by Hollywoo in this season of “BoJack Horseman.”) • After staging a walkout on Monday, the group Time’s Up has called for Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh to withdraw his nomination to the Supreme Court. Actresses like Natalie Portman have been showing their support for Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were teenagers. • The smash hit true-crime series “Making a Murderer” will return to Netflix for a second season on Oct. 19. The 10 episodes will look at the “high-stakes post-conviction process” in the original Wisconsin cases. [NY Times] • Padma Lakshmi is the latest very famous woman to write a Times op-ed about her experience with sexual assault. “We all have a lot to lose if we put a time limit on telling the truth about sexual assault and if we hold on to the codes of silence that for generations have allowed men to hurt women with impunity,” she writes. • In 1995, Barbra Streisand complained to then-C.A.A. exec Michael Ovitz about sexism in the industry. “Barbra,” he said, “you know my 15-year-old son? All he and his friends think about is girls, but you’re no longer on their list.” For some unknown reason, Ovitz includes this anecdote in a memoir attempting to atone for his Hollywood cruelty. Janet Maslin is unconvinced, and her Times review is a delicious takedown of old-school Hollywood power. Is this some sort of new internet insult? No, no. Meechee is her character in the upcoming animated movie “Smallfoot,” and the meme was born in a song written in tribute to the movie posters: Oh. Who is this soulful dude? Gabriel Gundacker, a deeply online comedian, who was so good at Vine that he’s still making money off his greatest hits. How does Zendaya feel about all this? She’s into it! So ... it’s just a catchy song? Pretty much. Sometimes it’s fun to be self-consciously dumb online, rather than accidentally. It seems Serial is truly back: After a disappointing second season, the podcast’s third season has had 1.4 million downloads per episode since Thursday, according to Vulture. Colorful characters, revealing details, the thoughtful Sarah Koenig — it’s good! But this is not background listening. There’s a lot going on in the multiple cases they cover from a Cleveland court. Listen here. There’s an awful lot of Johnny Depp in the new trailer for the “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” sequel. He plays the title character in “The Crimes of Grindelwald,” and apparently the filmmakers have stuck to J.K. Rowling’s word when she said last year that they were “genuinely happy to have Johnny playing a major character in the movies,” despite calls to recast the role after Depp’s then-wife Amber Heard filed for a temporary restraining order against him, citing physical violence.

"Politician’s Affair Puts Spotlight on Australia’s Crony Culture","SYDNEY — Australia’s deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, has spent most of his career advocating for rural voters and strong families, and shouting down welfare cheats. But on Wednesday in Parliament, he offered a full-throated defense for remaining in office despite an affair with a former staff member who is now pregnant, and with whom he lived rent-free in an apartment owned by a wealthy supporter. Such is the scandal known as #barnababy, which in just one week has gone from a debate about privacy, sex and tabloids to an indictment of Australia’s crony politics. “This whole incident is absolutely tailor-made to undercut people’s faith in the Parliament, which is already at an all-time low,” said Susan Harris Rimmer, a law professor at Griffith University in Queensland. The longer Mr. Joyce stays in office, she added, the more resentment about politics grows. All of Canberra, Australia’s capital, seems to be on trial now, with its cozy, clubby ways looking increasingly inappropriate. “It is not a healthy place,” Professor Rimmer said. “It runs on alcohol and gossip and fumes and power.” Mr. Joyce, a gregarious bull of a man often seen in a trademark Akubra bush hat, now faces a series of uncomfortable questions: • Were public funds used to cultivate an extramarital affair? • How did he and his new partner, Vikki Campion, a former journalist, end up in a supporter’s free apartment? • How did Ms. Campion secure a high-paying job with a Parliament colleague? • And, did Mr. Joyce grope a woman after an awards ceremony in 2011? Mr. Joyce, 50, has denied groping and other ministerial misconduct. He has spent much of the week offering defiance and remorse, and trying to hold on to his job. He acknowledged his relationship with Ms. Campion on Tuesday, apologizing to his family, his constituents and the National Party of Australia, which he still leads. But he also told his party colleagues he would not step down. “Every political career has a time of trial,” he said. His stand fits with his longstanding “just a bloke” appeal. He grew up on a farm in Tamworth, in Australia’s southeast, which is home of the nation’s largest country music festival. Mr. Joyce is known as an off-the-cuff maverick who is loyal less to ideology than to his constituents. But since 2004, he has been a Canberra man. He was a senator for Queensland and then joined the House of Representatives in 2013. He became leader of the National Party and deputy prime minister in 2016. Mr. Joyce is no stranger to scandal. A few years ago he made headlines worldwide when he threatened to euthanize two dogs belonging to Johnny Depp and Amber Heard after the celebrity couple brought them to Australia without the proper documentation and quarantine. Last year, Mr. Joyce was one of several politicians revealed as holding dual citizenship. After the High Court ruled that he had been ineligible to run for Parliament because of it, Mr. Joyce renounced his New Zealand citizenship and returned to his district to campaign again for his seat. He won comfortably. But experts say the backlash has only been intensified by his supposed authenticity, his eagerness to parade his wife and four children in political campaigns, and his brash conservative positions, like his opposition to same-sex marriage, which he argued would destroy families. “The public expected a Barnaby that was a solid country family man, and we’re seeing that he’s not that at all,” said Jill Sheppard, a lecturer in politics at the Australian National University in Canberra. “If there was a political trait Australians hate, it’s hypocrisy,” Professor Rimmer said. But the biggest threat to Mr. Joyce’s career may involve questions about the mingling of adultery, money and power. Records show he claimed a travel allowance for 50 nights in Canberra last year when Parliament was not in session, far more than other senior leaders. Government watchdogs and journalists have also zeroed in on two high-paying positions that were allegedly created for Ms. Campion in the offices of a party colleague, Senator Matt Canavan. Mr. Joyce and Prime Minister Turnbull — who has continued to back him — said the jobs were beyond reproach because Ms. Campion was not technically his partner at the time. Mr. Joyce’s critics contest that assertion. Officially, for now, Mr. Joyce still has the support of his party. “Barnaby Joyce is the best deliverer for rural and regional Australians in generations,” Bridget McKenzie, the Nationals deputy, told reporters on Wednesday. But time is not on his side. Mr. Turnbull is scheduled for an overseas trip that includes meeting with President Trump on Feb. 23, which would make Mr. Joyce the acting prime minister. A broader reckoning on the capital’s workplace culture may also be coming. “If the Australian public feels the political class is isolated and don’t appreciate their concerns, then that’s a problem the political class has to respond to,” said Andrew Giles, a Labor Party politician. “We’re not meeting people’s expectations,” he added. “And they’re legitimate expectations.”","sydney australia deputy prime minister barnaby joyce spent career advocating rural voters strong families shouting welfare cheats wednesday parliament offered throated defense remaining office affair staff pregnant lived rent free apartment owned wealthy supporter scandal barnababy week debate privacy sex tabloids indictment australia crony politics incident absolutely tailor undercut people faith parliament time low susan harris rimmer law professor griffith university queensland joyce stays office added resentment politics grows canberra australia capital trial cozy clubby increasingly inappropriate healthy professor rimmer runs alcohol gossip fumes power joyce gregarious bull trademark akubra bush hat series uncomfortable questions public funds cultivate extramarital affair partner vikki campion journalist supporter free apartment ms campion secure paying job parliament colleague joyce grope woman awards ceremony joyce denied groping ministerial misconduct spent week offering defiance remorse hold job acknowledged relationship ms campion tuesday apologizing family constituents national party australia leads told party colleagues step political career time trial stand fits longstanding bloke appeal grew farm tamworth australia southeast home nation largest country music festival joyce cuff maverick loyal ideology constituents canberra senator queensland joined house representatives leader national party deputy prime minister joyce stranger scandal ago headlines worldwide threatened euthanize dogs belonging johnny depp amber heard celebrity couple brought australia proper documentation quarantine joyce politicians revealed holding dual citizenship court ruled ineligible run parliament joyce renounced zealand citizenship returned district campaign seat won comfortably experts backlash intensified supposed authenticity eagerness parade wife children political campaigns brash conservative positions opposition sex marriage argued destroy families public expected barnaby solid country family jill sheppard lecturer politics australian national university canberra political trait australians hate hypocrisy professor rimmer biggest threat joyce career involve questions mingling adultery money power records claimed travel allowance nights canberra parliament session senior leaders government watchdogs journalists zeroed paying positions allegedly created ms campion offices party colleague senator matt canavan joyce prime minister turnbull continued jobs reproach ms campion technically partner time joyce critics contest assertion officially joyce support party barnaby joyce deliverer rural regional australians generations bridget mckenzie nationals deputy told reporters wednesday time turnbull scheduled overseas trip includes meeting president trump feb joyce acting prime minister broader reckoning capital workplace culture coming australian public feels political class isolated don concerns political class respond andrew giles labor party politician meeting people expectations added legitimate expectations"
"Review: ‘Finding Neverland,’ a Broadway Musical With Matthew Morrison","The first entrance applause occurs before even the overture begins. Riotous clapping is occasioned when a bright point of light travels over the ceiling and the curtain of the Lunt-Fontanne Theater in New York, where the push-button, button-pushing musical “Finding Neverland” opened on Wednesday night. This little light, you see, is pretty much guaranteed to elicit a Pavlovian response from anyone familiar with the story of “Peter Pan” in its various incarnations, which surely includes everyone who shelled out the big bucks for this show. Said light equals Tinker Bell, the temperamental fairy who requires your applause to stay alive. Clap if you believe in brand names. Directed by Diane Paulus — with the guidance of Harvey Weinstein, its chief producer — “Finding Neverland” is filled with such triggers. The most brazen, perhaps, comes when an English actor in a pub asks an American, “Do they say ‘cheers’ where you come from, mate?” The simple query sets the audience aroar. That’s because the man playing the American happens to be Kelsey Grammer, who was a regular on the long-running sitcom “Cheers.” Neither Mr. Grammer nor the show’s leading man, Matthew Morrison (of the television series “Glee”), appear wholly invested in their performances. But that’s O.K. Their mere presences do most of the work for them. As with many a Broadway musical these days, “Finding Neverland” — which features a book by James Graham and sticky soft-pop power ballads by Gary Barlow and Eliot Kennedy — is based on a popular film. That would be the 2004 biopic about the playwright J. M. Barrie, the creator of Peter Pan, which starred Johnny Depp and for which Mr. Weinstein was an executive producer. The stage version of “Finding Neverland” is no replica of the film, though it might have been better if it were. Instead, it heightens the screenplay’s sentimentality, tidy psychologizing and life-affirming messages by thickening their syrup and corn quotients in ways presumably deemed palatable to theatergoing children and their parents. The show brings to mind those supersize sodas sold in movie theaters, which Mayor Michael Bloomberg once quixotically campaigned against. Like such drinks, “Finding Neverland” is largely made up of empty calories. Perhaps the nutrients were leached out of it by its long and arduous gestation. First presented in Leicester, England, in 2012, the show was reborn and completely retooled at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass., where I saw it last summer. It didn’t seem quite as objectionable to me at that time. This was partly because it was still a work in progress, partly because it was on a smaller scale and partly because that production’s Barrie, Jeremy Jordan, exuded a sweetness-thinning anguish that seemed to be about something other than an actor’s being stuck in an uncomfortable production. For New York, Mr. Jordan has been replaced with the more famous (and more Ken-doll handsome) Mr. Morrison. The Cambridge version’s original, agreeable leading lady, Laura Michelle Kelly, remains. But Mr. Grammer has been brought in to fill the double supporting roles of Barrie’s American producer, Charles Frohman, and of Captain Hook (replacing a very good Michael McGrath), the fictional creation who in this version springs out of Barrie’s id for the first-act finale. That’s right. It takes an id to create a Neverland in this account of Barrie’s life. At the beginning our bearded, Scottish-born hero is a successful and fashionable playwright suffering from writer’s block and an unhappy marriage to a superficial socialite (Teal Wicks). Then one day in Kensington Gardens, he meets four enchanting little boys, the Llewelyn Davies brothers. He happily joins in their rambunctious games of pretend, which testify to the philosophy, later expressed in song, that “the world is so mysterious and wild/when you start to see it through the eyes of a child.” The spectacle of a strange man playing in the park with pink-cheeked kids usually sets off alarm bells, at least in this era of the Amber Alert. But not to worry. Mr. Morrison, in a determinedly neutral performance, has been divested of any hints of sensuality. What’s more, those boys have a mother, Sylvia (Ms. Kelly), a widow with a bad cough and an inner child who immediately gravitates to Barrie, to whom she says, “I think to have faith is to have wings.” And from romping with Sylvia and her sons, Barrie will discover that playtime can inspire a play. Thus is born the work that will guarantee his immortality, as well as theater’s most enduring portrait of arrested development. Featuring a blue-tinged vintage postcard-like set by Scott Pask, with period costumes by Suttirat Anne Larlarb, “Finding Neverland” follows Barrie’s struggles against his own inhibitions and a world of starchy, disapproving grown-ups. Like the Disney stage version of “Mary Poppins” (which starred Ms. Kelly in London), the show zigzags between sunlight and midnight (Kenneth Posner did the lighting), what with Sylvia’s ominous cough and Barrie’s itchy id. But there’s always sugar in the shadows, even in that climactic fantasy sequence when Captain Hook materializes to tell Barrie to get in touch with his dark side. “Unleash me!” he instructs Barrie. And our hero loosens up enough to tear open his shirt, center-stage, and, in the second act, to finally share a kiss with Sylvia. Barrie’s evolution is set to a score that brings to mind the songs that accompany animated adventure films and are favored by contestants on “The Voice” and “American Idol.” (Mr. Barlow, the composer, was an original member of the British boy band Take That and a judge on an “American Idol”-style British television series.) Every song — the titles include “Circus of Your Mind” and “We’re All Made of Stars” — vaguely reminds you of some recording you have heard in the background of your life. How can you hear the wail of a penny whistle without thinking of Celine Dion bewailing the titular ship’s sinking in “Titanic”? (Ms. Kelly and Mr. Morrison even strike the signature pose of the star-crossed lovers from that movie.) I’m assuming the theory is that high volume will obliterate our awareness that this music is fatally ersatz. But there’s no disguising the feeling that almost every element of the production has a secondhand, synthetic quality: the dialogue, the jerky choreography (by Mia Michaels), the jokes, the anachronistic depiction of the show people who put on Barrie’s plays. (One of them, asked if he believes in fairies, answers: “My good man, I work in the theater. I see them every day.”) It may well be the show’s very lack of freshness that accounts for its appeal. “Finding Neverland” was a sellout in Cambridge, and it’s already doing boffo box office here. When Barrie says he’s working on a new and surprising play, his producer, Frohman, responds that he doesn’t like surprises. “I said I wanted something new,” he says. “New does not necessarily mean different. Think of it like — a new penny. It looks and feels the same as an old penny, right? It’s just — shinier.” By this criterion, “Finding Neverland” might well be a Charles Frohman production.","entrance applause occurs overture begins riotous clapping occasioned bright light travels ceiling curtain lunt fontanne theater york push button button pushing musical finding neverland wednesday night light pretty guaranteed elicit pavlovian response familiar story peter pan incarnations surely includes shelled bucks light equals tinker bell temperamental fairy requires applause stay alive clap brand names directed diane paulus guidance harvey weinstein chief producer finding neverland filled triggers brazen english actor pub american cheers mate simple query sets audience aroar playing american kelsey grammer regular running sitcom cheers grammer leading matthew morrison television series glee wholly invested performances mere presences broadway musical days finding neverland features book james graham sticky soft pop power ballads gary barlow eliot kennedy based popular film biopic playwright barrie creator peter pan starred johnny depp weinstein executive producer stage version finding neverland replica film heightens screenplay sentimentality tidy psychologizing life affirming messages thickening syrup corn quotients deemed palatable theatergoing children parents brings mind supersize sodas sold movie theaters mayor michael bloomberg quixotically campaigned drinks finding neverland empty calories nutrients leached arduous gestation leicester england reborn completely retooled american repertory theater cambridge mass summer didn objectionable time partly progress partly scale partly production barrie jeremy jordan exuded sweetness thinning anguish actor stuck uncomfortable production york jordan replaced famous ken doll handsome morrison cambridge version original agreeable leading lady laura michelle kelly remains grammer brought fill double supporting roles barrie american producer charles frohman captain hook replacing michael mcgrath fictional creation version springs barrie id act finale takes id create neverland account barrie life beginning bearded scottish born hero successful fashionable playwright suffering writer block unhappy marriage superficial socialite teal wicks day kensington gardens meets enchanting boys llewelyn davies brothers happily joins rambunctious games pretend testify philosophy expressed song world mysterious wild start eyes child spectacle strange playing park pink cheeked kids sets alarm bells era amber alert worry morrison determinedly neutral performance divested hints sensuality boys mother sylvia ms kelly widow bad cough child immediately gravitates barrie faith wings romping sylvia sons barrie discover playtime inspire play born guarantee immortality theater enduring portrait arrested development featuring blue tinged vintage postcard set scott pask period costumes suttirat anne larlarb finding neverland barrie struggles inhibitions world starchy disapproving grown ups disney stage version mary poppins starred ms kelly london zigzags sunlight midnight kenneth posner lighting sylvia ominous cough barrie itchy id sugar shadows climactic fantasy sequence captain hook materializes barrie touch dark unleash instructs barrie hero loosens tear shirt center stage act finally share kiss sylvia barrie evolution set score brings mind songs accompany animated adventure films favored contestants voice american idol barlow composer original british boy band judge american idol style british television series song titles include circus mind stars vaguely reminds recording heard background life hear wail penny whistle thinking celine dion bewailing titular ship sinking titanic ms kelly morrison strike signature pose star crossed lovers movie assuming theory volume obliterate awareness music fatally ersatz disguising feeling element production secondhand synthetic quality dialogue jerky choreography mia michaels jokes anachronistic depiction people barrie plays believes fairies answers theater day lack freshness accounts appeal finding neverland sellout cambridge boffo box office barrie surprising play producer frohman responds doesn surprises necessarily penny feels penny shinier criterion finding neverland charles frohman production"
"Review: In ‘London Fields,’ Sex, Apocalypse and Writer’s Block","“London Fields,” directed by Matthew Cullen and adapted from Martin Amis’s 1989 novel, is, quite simply, horrendous — a trashy, tortured misfire from beginning to end. In limbo for years because of a number of legal disputes, this laboriously bizarre picture is narrated by Samson Young (Billy Bob Thornton, drained and dispirited), a dying, creatively stalled American writer who has swapped apartments with a celebrated British author (Jason Isaacs). “There was no book without the girl,” Samson intones as his mysteriously mourning muse, Nicola Six (Amber Heard), appears in black veil and a cloud of pheromones. The year is 1999 and some kind of worldwide catastrophe is unfolding, but Nicola’s main problems seem to be a lack of outerwear and the ability to foresee her own murder. Whether her lover-cum-killer will be the besotted banker (Theo James), the cretinous criminal (an odiously mouth-breathing Jim Sturgess), or Samson himself is a riddle we could not possibly be less interested in solving. The arrival of Johnny Depp as a ludicrously dressed gangster with an entourage of weirdos does nothing to reverse that position. (It does, however, signal that the movie’s costume designer was having much more fun than any of its stars.) Failing to even glancingly approximate the book’s trippy energy or linguistic dazzle, Cullen ricochets between Heard’s slow-motion, perfume-ad close-ups and lurid, comic-book noir. The result is alienating and bogus, as senseless as the image of Nicola’s floating, diaphanous panties. “I’m pretty worried that the critics are going to call you a male fantasy figure,” Samson frets. Done.","london fields directed matthew cullen adapted martin amis simply horrendous trashy tortured misfire beginning limbo legal disputes laboriously bizarre picture narrated samson billy bob thornton drained dispirited dying creatively stalled american writer swapped apartments celebrated british author jason isaacs book girl samson intones mysteriously mourning muse nicola amber heard appears black veil cloud pheromones worldwide catastrophe unfolding nicola main lack outerwear ability foresee murder lover cum killer besotted banker theo james cretinous criminal odiously mouth breathing jim sturgess samson riddle possibly solving arrival johnny depp ludicrously dressed gangster entourage weirdos reverse position signal movie costume designer fun stars failing glancingly approximate book trippy energy linguistic dazzle cullen ricochets heard slow motion perfume ad close ups lurid comic book noir result alienating bogus senseless image nicola floating diaphanous panties pretty worried critics call male fantasy figure samson frets"
"Summer Movie Release Schedule 2017","All dates are subject to change. THE DROWNING An independent filmmaker with an experimental streak, Bette Gordon (whose credits include “Variety,” the 1983 riff on “Vertigo”) directs this thriller centered on a forensic psychologist (Josh Charles). In the Pat Barker novel “Border Crossing,” on which it’s based, he rescues a young man from suicide, then learns that years earlier he had testified against him as an expert witness. Julia Stiles also stars. MANIFESTO Those who can’t get enough of Cate Blanchett will find her here playing 13 roles. The words the characters recite are drawn from more than 50 manifestoes — most of them artistic declarations from the 20th century. The film was shown in installation form at the Park Avenue Armory in December and January before heading to Sundance. FOLK HERO & FUNNY GUY A flailing comedian (Alex Karpovsky) tries to regain his mojo by going on tour with an old friend, a folk-rock musician (Wyatt Russell). Meredith Hagner, Michael Ian Black and Melanie Lynskey also star. GET ME ROGER STONE Never camera shy, the political operative Roger Stone, often credited as a pioneer in negative campaigning, recounts the story of his career and, in particular, his involvement in grooming Donald Trump as a candidate. Mr. Trump’s former campaign chief Paul Manafort also appears in this documentary, which will be released in theaters and on Netflix simultaneously. HOUNDS OF LOVE It’s not a tribute to the Kate Bush album of the same title, but an Australian thriller about a young woman (Ashleigh Cummings) who’s abducted by a serial-killer couple (Emma Booth and Stephen Curry). The news media in Perth have noted similarities between the plot and a real-life case. KING ARTHUR: LEGEND OF THE SWORD After two revisionist takes on Sherlock Holmes, the director Guy Ritchie aims to show off the hipper side of King Arthur, a character whose last major reboot was in a 2004 Antoine Fuqua film. An irreverent Charlie Hunnam plays the title role; Jude Law is the pretender to Arthur’s rightful throne. THE LAST SHAMAN A suicidal man ventures into the Amazon in search of a shaman he thinks will heal him. He also tries the hallucinogenic brew ayahuasca. Documentary filmmakers follow along. LOWRIDERS Gabriel Chavarria plays a Mexican-American street artist with big dreams in East Los Angeles; his creative aspirations put him at odds with his tough-love father (Demián Bichir), who runs a garage catering to the neighborhood’s lowrider scene. Theo Rossi plays his ex-convict brother; Eva Longoria and Melissa Benoist (“Supergirl”) also star. MERI PYAARI BINDU Has Bollywood ever made a musical about mixtape nostalgia? A writer’s-blocked author (Ayushmann Khurrana) finds his muse after listening to an old cassette. PARIS CAN WAIT Does anyone in the Coppola family not make films? Eleanor Coppola (the wife of Francis Ford Coppola) has directed before — she was one of the filmmakers behind the documentary “Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker’s Apocalypse,” which went behind the scenes of “Apocalypse Now.” But this is her first fiction feature, which she also wrote. Diane Lane, playing the wife of a Hollywood producer (Alec Baldwin), finds herself rejuvenated by a car trip across France. SNATCHED Pairing Goldie Hawn and Amy Schumer in the same comedy is one of those brilliant comic ideas that just needed to happen. They play a bickering mother and daughter who bond after being kidnapped on a tropical vacation. The screenwriter Katie Dippold (“The Heat”) supplied the banter; Jonathan Levine (“50/50”) directs. STEFAN ZWEIG: FAREWELL TO EUROPE The work of the Austrian writer Stefan Zweig has inspired many movies (including “Letter From an Unknown Woman” and “The Grand Budapest Hotel”). So maybe it was inevitable that he would get a biopic of his own. This film, by Maria Schrader, focuses on the years 1936 to 1942, when Zweig (Josef Hader) lived in exile overseas. TRACKTOWN In case you thought world-class athletes were insufficiently talented, Alexi Pappas, an American-born runner who represented Greece at the 2016 Olympics, wrote and stars in this story of a long-distance runner who falls for a boy at the bakery while she is sidelined with an injury. She also directs, with Jeremy Teicher. URBAN HYMN Taking the riots that swept Britain in 2011 as a topical peg, this drama focuses on a troubled teenager (Letitia Wright) who is coaxed out of her shell by a social worker (Shirley Henderson) at her group home and encouraged to fulfill her talent for singing. Michael Caton-Jones (“Rob Roy”) directs. THE WALL In Iraq, two American soldiers (Aaron Taylor-Johnson and John Cena) are trapped by an Iraqi sniper. Behind a crumbling wall, Mr. Taylor-Johnson maintains radio contact with the man who almost — almost — has him in his sights. We’ll soon find out whether Doug Liman, the director of “The Bourne Identity” and “Edge of Tomorrow,” is capable of drawing out suspense on a tighter scale. THE WEDDING PLAN The ultra-Orthodox filmmaker Rama Burshtein made one of the more intriguing recent splashes on the festival circuit with “Fill the Void” (2013), a Jewish take on Jane Austen themes. In “The Wedding Plan,” called “Through the Wall” at festivals, a 32-year-old (Noa Koler) pre-emptively plans a wedding, giving herself a three-week deadline to find a husband. WHISKY GALORE! In this remake of Alexander Mackendrick’s 1949 Ealing Studios comedy, the wartime residents of a Scottish island that has run out of whisky face off with the commander (Eddie Izzard) of a ship that’s run aground, which happens to be carrying 50,000 cases of the stuff. ABACUS: SMALL ENOUGH TO JAIL Steve James (“Hoop Dreams”) follows the legal travails of Abacus Federal Savings Bank, a pillar of the immigrant community in Chinatown, that was charged in 2012 with mortgage fraud. (It was acquitted in 2015.) Although there’s a newsworthy hook — the film suggests that Abacus was a scapegoat for larger banks after the financial crisis — the movie is primarily an affectionate look at the Sung family, which runs the bank, and its resolve in the face of adversity. AFTERIMAGE The Polish director Andrzej Wajda, who died at 90 in October, grappled one last time with his country’s history in his final film, a portrait of the painter Wladyslaw Strzeminski (Boguslaw Linda), who pushed back against the postwar Communist regime’s mandates for art and sacrificed his career as a result. ALIEN: COVENANT Face huggers! Bloodthirsty anamorphic-melon-headed aliens! Katherine Waterston in a very strange hairdo! Ridley Scott again revisits the franchise that may be his most lasting legacy, with an entry set sometime after the events in “Prometheus” (2012) but before those in “Alien” (1979). Along with Ms. Waterston, Billy Crudup, Amy Seimetz, Demián Bichir, Danny McBride and Carmen Ejogo are among the space colonists in for a rude surprise, with Michael Fassbender returning from “Prometheus” as an android (or two). THE COMMUNE You wouldn’t know it from the high-society recriminations in his Dogma 95 landmark, “The Celebration,” but the Danish director Thomas Vinterberg was raised in a commune. Although this 1970s-set film isn’t a memoir, it draws on that experience. Trine Dyrholm and Ulrich Thomsen play a couple who decide to start their own group-living arrangement. DEVIL’S DOMAIN You’ve seen movies about Faustian bargains, but have you seen one about a girl (Madi Vodane) who makes a pact with the Devil (Linda Bella) to get revenge on her high school cyberbullies? DIARY OF A WIMPY KID: THE LONG HAUL The wimpy kid grew up, so Hollywood found a new one. In the fourth film based on Jeff Kinney’s popular books, Greg (now Jason Ian Drucker) goes on a family road trip. Alicia Silverstone and Tom Everett Scott, also on their first outings in the Wimpy-verse, play his parents. EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING Housebound for life because of a compromised immune system, an 18-year-old (Amandla Stenberg) falls for the boy (Nick Robinson) who moves in next door in this adaptation of Nicola Yoon’s best-selling young-adult novel. FIGHT FOR SPACE Looking back over the history of the United States space program, this documentary advocates for its vigorous future. The interviewees include the Apollo 13 commander, Jim Lovell, and the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, who seems to violate the laws of science by being everywhere at all times. HELL ON EARTH: THE FALL OF SYRIA AND THE RISE OF ISIS Directing jointly, the author and filmmaker Sebastian Junger and his frequent producing collaborator Nick Quested (“Restrepo”) examine the origins of the Islamic State, with a particular emphasis on the civil war in Syria — an exceedingly timely topic. ICAROS: A VISION Leonor Caraballo, who directed this movie with Matteo Norzi but died from cancer before it was complete, is said to have based it on her own experiences. It follows an American (Ana Cecilia Stieglitz) in the Peruvian Amazon as she seeks shamanic healing for an illness. LEGION OF BROTHERS Members of two United States Special Forces teams that were among the earliest American troops sent into Afghanistan in 2001 recount their missions in this documentary. PAINT IT BLACK Alia Shawkat plays a Los Angeles woman who, after her boyfriend’s death, becomes enmeshed in a toxic, codependent relationship with the man’s mother (Janet McTeer). The actress Amber Tamblyn makes her directing debut, working from the novel by Janet Fitch (“White Oleander”). THE SURVIVALIST A standout at the 2015 Tribeca Film Festival, Stephen Fingleton’s debut feature is a terse portrait of life in a postapocalyptic wood. Martin McCann is the title character, who lives alone and fends off all comers until two women (Mia Goth and Olwen Fouéré) turn up at his doorstep. WAKEFIELD For her second directorial feature, the veteran screenwriter Robin Swicord (“Little Women”) adapts an E. L. Doctorow story that appeared in The New Yorker. Bryan Cranston stars as a man who, on impulse, leaves his family and moves into the attic of his garage. Jennifer Garner plays his wife. THE WOMAN WHO LEFT Ten years ago, the Filipino director Lav Diaz was a forbidding figure, even among extreme cinephiles. At film festivals they would ask one another in hushed tones whether they really planned to see his nine-hour “Death in the Land of Encantos.” Lately, Mr. Diaz seems to have widened his appeal, earning acclaim for his Dostoyevsky-inspired “Norte, the End of History” and for this new drama, which won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in 2016. At nearly four hours, it is also one of Mr. Diaz’s shortest films. RESTLESS CREATURE: WENDY WHELAN Heavy on ballet performances, this documentary focuses on Ms. Whelan, a principal dancer at the New York City Ballet until 2014. It catches her at a difficult moment, when she has surgery for an injury. BAYWATCH Directed by Seth Gordon (“Horrible Bosses”), the latest TV property resurrection follows in the tradition of “21 Jump Street,” turning the 1989-2001 drama that was already close to camp into an outright comedy. Dwayne Johnson, Zac Efron, Alexandra Daddario and Priyanka Chopra have readied their beach bods for the occasion. BEAUTIFUL ACCIDENT In a comedy from China, a lawyer (Gwei Lun-Mei) awakes from a car accident to find herself living a life not taken: She’s a housewife and mother. BERLIN SYNDROME Teresa Palmer plays an Australian tourist who discovers after a fling that her date (Max Riemelt) has locked her in — and not into his schedule. Directed by Cate Shortland (the well-regarded “Lore”), this thriller was briefly the talk of Sundance because of a technical mishap at its world premiere. But some people liked the movie, too. BLACK BUTTERFLY With bad weather on the way, a screenwriter (Antonio Banderas) invites a drifter (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) to take the guest bed at his mountain cabin. It turns out the drifter doesn’t care for his latest script. Knee-jerk “Misery” comparisons may be off: It’s a remake of a French TV movie. BUENA VISTA SOCIAL CLUB: ADIOS The documentary filmmaker Lucy Walker (“Countdown to Zero”) makes a follow-up to Wim Wenders’s 1999 hit documentary, “Buena Vista Social Club,” revisiting some of the same musicians, including Eliades Ochoa and Omara Portuondo. DRONE In an up-to-the-minute home imprisonment thriller, Sean Bean plays a drone pilot who is tracked down in suburbia by a Pakistani businessman (Patrick Sabongui), who wants revenge for the deaths of his wife and daughter. HERMIA & HELENA The Argentine director Matías Piñeiro always uses Shakespeare for inspiration: “Viola” riffed on “Twelfth Night,” while “The Princess of France” borrowed elements of “Love’s Labour’s Lost.” That trend continues with “Hermia & Helena,” which mixes “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” with aspects of Mr. Piñeiro’s own biography to follow a theater director (Agustina Muñoz) in New York. JOSHUA: TEENAGER VS. SUPERPOWER Joshua is Joshua Wong, who at 13 became an activist to protest Beijing’s encroaching influence in Hong Kong. This documentary tells his story. LONG STRANGE TRIP Well received at Sundance, this four-hour look at the Grateful Dead spans the band’s entire career. For those who think four hours of “Sugar Magnolia” sounds a bit too mellow, the director, Amir Bar-Lev, has often made documentaries that dig beneath the surface (“The Tillman Story”). PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MEN TELL NO TALES Having already appeared as a Bond villain, Javier Bardem joins the producer Jerry Bruckheimer’s long-running “Pirates of the Caribbean” series as Captain Salazar, a ghost sailor with a vendetta against Jack Sparrow. Johnny Depp is back for comic anchoring; the Norwegian directors Joachim Ronning and Espen Sandberg, are no strangers to the high seas after their foreign-language Oscar nominee, “Kon-Tiki.” WAR MACHINE Working from “The Operators: The Wild and Terrifying Inside Story of America’s War in Afghanistan,” a nonfiction book by the journalist Michael Hastings (who wrote the Rolling Stone article about Stanley McChrystal), the director David Michôd (“Animal Kingdom”) charts the changing fortunes of a United States general (Brad Pitt) with a dash of Strangelove-ian mockery. Other notable cast members include Topher Grace, Anthony Michael Hall, Tilda Swinton, Ben Kingsley and Lakeith Stanfield (“Get Out”). THE WOMEN’S BALCONY This comedy from Israel concerns the actual and physical fallout after a synagogue balcony where women are separated from men buckles during a bar mitzvah. ALL ABOUT THE MONEY A man who goads his friends into vacationing in Colombia has an ulterior motive: He wants to claim the bounty on a drug dealer. This comedy stars Eddie Griffin and Blake Freeman; Mr. Freeman directs. BAND AID A bickering couple (Zoe Lister-Jones and Adam Pally) start a band with the hope that making music will help them smooth over the rough patches in their relationship. Ms. Lister-Jones (TV’s “Life in Pieces”) is not only the lead but also the director (in her debut), screenwriter and co-lyricist. Fred Armisen also stars. CAPTAIN UNDERPANTS: THE FIRST EPIC MOVIE After hypnotizing their school’s principal, two prankster students inadvertently turn him into Captain Underpants, the Jockey-wearing superhero of the comics they’ve written. This animated feature is based on the long-running children’s book series by Dav Pilkey. Kevin Hart, Ed Helms, Thomas Middleditch, Jordan Peele and Kristen Schaal supply some of the voices. CHURCHILL Brian Cox may sound like a more natural fit for Winston Churchill than John Lithgow did in “The Crown,” but can you picture John Slattery (Roger Sterling from “Mad Men”) as Dwight D. Eisenhower? Both Mr. Cox and Mr. Slattery, plus Miranda Richardson as Clementine Churchill, play the famous figures in a film about the road to D-Day. DEAN Demetri Martin, a former fixture of “The Daily Show,” directed, wrote and stars in this film, playing an illustrator who, after his mother’s death, works through a complicated relationship with his father (Kevin Kline). From last year’s Tribeca Film Festival, Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times that Mr. Martin “delivers a winning combination of winsomeness and rue.” Gillian Jacobs and Mary Steenburgen also star. THE EXCEPTION A Nazi soldier (Jai Courtney) assigned to look after the exiled Kaiser Wilhelm II (Christopher Plummer) has an affair with a maid (Lily James) who is both Jewish and a spy. Eddie Marsan (as Himmler) and Janet McTeer add to the intrigue. The director is David Leveaux, a multiple Tony nominee making his first film. HANDSOME DEVIL Two roommates (Fionn O’Shea and Nicholas Galitzine), outcasts for different reasons, begin to warm to each other at a rugby-obsessed Irish boarding school. LETTERS FROM BAGHDAD Nicole Kidman just played the British adventurer Gertrude Bell, known to many as the female Lawrence of Arabia, in a biopic from Werner Herzog. Now Bell is the subject of a documentary that draws on century-old footage and Bell’s own letters. Tilda Swinton narrates. PAST LIFE In 1977, two Israeli sisters (Nelly Tagar and Joy Rieger) are prompted to unravel their seemingly upright father’s past actions in Holocaust-era Poland. Avi Nesher, of the much lighter “The Matchmaker” (2012), directs. VINCENT-N-ROXXY In an update of old noir themes, “Vincent-N-Roxxy” casts Emile Hirsch and Zoë Kravitz as a couple whom circumstances bring together and send on the lam. Romance follows to some degree, but word from last year’s Tribeca Film Festival suggests that violence dominates. Zoey Deutch co-stars. WONDER WOMAN After an appearance in “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,” in 2016, that was effectively a trailer within a film, Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) gets a long-teased movie of her own. Patty Jenkins (“Monster”) directs this origin story, which finds the superheroine leaving her life as an Amazon princess to fight in World War I. Chris Pine plays the pilot who rouses her to action. ASCENT Experience Mount Fuji — through a selection of 4,000 photographs snapped over 150 years. The Dutch artist Fiona Tan has built this experimental film out of those stills. Screenings at Film Forum in New York will be free. AWAKENING THE ZODIAC Shane West and Leslie Bibb play a couple who find a 40-year-old film reel that they believe was shot by the Zodiac killer in California. They try to sleuth him out. This displeases the Zodiac killer, who is probably a member of AARP by now. BEATRIZ AT DINNER A Mexican massage therapist and healer (Salma Hayek) and a billionaire hotel owner (John Lithgow) butt heads at a dinner party. This new collaboration between the director Miguel Arteta and the screenwriter Mike White (who previously worked together on “Chuck & Buck” and “The Good Girl”) had more than a few critics at Sundance sensing a commentary on Donald J. Trump. Connie Britton, David Warshofsky, Amy Landecker and Chloë Sevigny are among the mortified faces around the table. CAMERA OBSCURA Suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, a war photographer begins to see real premonitions of deaths in his pictures. It’s a horror film, naturally. DAWSON CITY: FROZEN TIME In the silent era, the Gold Rush town of Dawson City in the Yukon was the last stop on the film-shipping circuit. The creative solutions used to dispose of flammable nitrate stock resulted in the inadvertent preservation of 500 films — forgotten reels were excavated in the 1970s. Bill Morrison (the found-footage collage “Decasia”) uses those clips to tell a story that interweaves film history and a sociological history of Dawson. 11:55 A returning Marine (Victor Almanzar) is pressed into dealing with old wounds back home, in what — if its title and early reviews are to be trusted — is effectively a replay of “High Noon.” With Elizabeth Rodriguez, Shirley Rumierk, John Leguizamo and Julia Stiles. THE HERO The veteran western star Sam Elliott (The Stranger in “The Big Lebowski”) is cast precisely to type as a veteran western star, who, like John Wayne in “The Shootist,” is prompted to settle accounts after receiving a cancer diagnosis. Nick Offerman, Laura Prepon and Krysten Ritter play figures in his life. Brett Haley (whose credits include another Sam Elliott picture, “I’ll See You in My Dreams”) writes and directs. IT COMES AT NIGHT Reviewing the domestic-discord drama “Krisha,” the debut feature of Trey Edward Shults, last year, Manohla Dargis wrote that the film’s opening shot made it feel like a horror movie. Mr. Shults makes good on that promise with his second feature — an actual horror movie, in which a patriarch (Joel Edgerton), determined to protect his wife and son from a threat outside, must decide what to do about another family that comes a-knockin’. With Riley Keough, Carmen Ejogo and Christopher Abbott (“James White”). MEGAN LEAVEY Gabriela Cowperthwaite (the Sea World exposé “Blackfish”) moves into dramatized features with this life-inspired movie about a Marine corporal (Kate Mara) and the two tours of duty she did with a bomb-sniffing dog named Rex. They were injured in an explosion and recuperated together. Edie Falco, Ramón Rodríguez and Common are also in the cast. MIDDLE MAN We’ve seen plenty of movies about unfunny aspiring comedians (“The King of Comedy,” “Mickey One”), but in this case, the would-be comic (Jim O’Heir), on the road to an audition in Las Vegas, picks up a hitchhiker, with murderous results. MILES Lacking the money for college, Miles (Tim Boardman) learns that he’s eligible for a scholarship if he plays on a volleyball team. The problem? It’s an all-girls team. Molly Shannon is his supportive mother; Missi Pyle, Yeardley Smith, Paul Reiser and Stephen Root co-star. MOSCOW NEVER SLEEPS An Irish filmmaker, Johnny O’Reilly, pays tribute to his adopted city of Moscow with this ensemble film. The trailer at least paints a much sunnier view of the city than Russian imports usually do. Aleksey Serebryakov (the protagonist of “Leviathan”) is in the large cast. THE MUMMY Want to feel old? Tom Cruise is now beginning his fourth decade as an action star. Want to feel a bit younger? Meet his new nemesis, a princess (Sofia Boutella) who has been mummified since ancient Egypt, in the latest reboot of a concept that Universal Pictures has dined off since the Boris Karloff original in 1932. Annabelle Wallis, Russell Crowe and Jake Johnson co-star. Alex Kurtzman (a screenwriter on two “Star Trek” movies, two “Transformers,” one “Amazing Spider-Man” and one “Mission: Impossible”) directs. MY COUSIN RACHEL The writer Daphne du Maurier has a pretty good track record when it comes to screen adaptations of her work (“Rebecca,” “The Birds,” “Don’t Look Now”), although Roger Michell (“Hyde Park on Hudson”) is not exactly Alfred Hitchcock. In any case, he directs this adaptation of du Maurier’s 1951 novel. Sam Claflin plays an Englishman who suspects that his cousin (Rachel Weisz) is responsible for the death of his uncle. NIGHT SCHOOL Andrew Cohn’s documentary follows three adults working to earn their high school degrees in Indianapolis. RANDOM TROPICAL PARADISE After his fiancée cheats on him — at his wedding — a groom (Bryan Greenberg) is persuaded by his friend (Brooks Wheelan) that it’s time for an all-bros vacation. Survivors of the “Hangover” movies know that this plan never works out. MOKA “Moka” is indeed French for “mocha,” the color of the car that a bereaved mother (Emmanuelle Devos) thinks killed her son. Wanting revenge, she insinuates her way into the life of the car’s owner (Nathalie Baye). Frédéric Mermoud directs; Switzerland supplies the scenery. ALL EYEZ ON ME The contours and contradictions of the life of the rapper Tupac Shakur (Demetrius Shipp Jr., in his first movie) are recounted in a biopic scheduled to be released on his birthday. Danai Gurira plays Tupac’s mother, a Black Panther, and Jamal Woolard is Biggie Smalls, a.k.a. the Notorious B.I.G., whom he played in the 2009 film “Notorious.” Benny Boom directed. THE BOOK OF HENRY The director Colin Trevorrow takes a break between franchises — “Jurassic World” and “Star Wars: Episode IX” — with a drama about an 11-year-old genius (Jaeden Lieberher) who, with his mother (Naomi Watts), sets out to rescue the girl next door (Maddie Ziegler), who seems to be abused by her stepfather (Dean Norris). Sarah Silverman and Jacob Tremblay also star. CARS 3 In the newest chapter of one of the less-loved Pixar series, the run-down Lightning McQueen (once again voiced by Owen Wilson) sets out to prove he’s still got some gas in the old engine with the assistance of a technician (Cristela Alonzo). Armie Hammer provides a voice for the latest model. 47 METERS DOWN Remember Richard Dreyfuss in the shark cage in “Jaws”? This is the same thing, except instead of Mr. Dreyfuss, picture Mandy Moore and Claire Holt as sisters, and the cage detaches from the boat, sending the pair plunging to depths that make sharks just one of their problems. And to think Blake Lively only had “The Shallows” to deal with. HARE KRISHNA! THE MANTRA, THE MOVEMENT AND THE SWAMI WHO STARTED IT ALL This documentary tells the story of A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, who founded the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, bringing the Krishna movement to the United States. HARMONIUM A prizewinner at Cannes, Koji Fukada’s film captures the ripple effects on one family after the father (Kanji Furutachi) invites an acquaintance (Tadanobu Asano), a recent ex-convict, to work with him in the garage next to his home. HEARING IS BELIEVING The star of this documentary is Rachel Flowers, who was born prematurely and went blind, but learned to play music and grew into a vibrant performer. The film follows two years in her family’s life. THE JOURNEY Dramatizing a difficult moment in the establishment of Northern Irish home rule, “The Journey” imagines that the Rev. Ian Paisley (Timothy Spall), a staunch British loyalist, and Martin McGuinness (Colm Meaney), a Sinn Fein politician and former Irish Republican Army leader, had to share a car during a summit at St. Andrews in 2006. Toby Stephens plays the British prime minister Tony Blair; Mark Lambert plays the Irish prime minister Bertie Ahern. John Hurt, who died in January, also stars. LOST IN PARIS The husband-and-wife directorial team of Fiona Gordon and Dominique Abel, who sometimes work in a deadpan, Jacques Tati-esque comic style, star in this comedy about a Canadian (Ms. Gordon) and her misadventures in Paris. Emmanuelle Riva, who died in January, plays her aunt. LUCKY Lucky, played by the film’s writer and director, Bari King, is an undocumented immigrant who gets enmeshed in a crime web and has to fight his way out. MAUDIE Sally Hawkins embodies the Nova Scotian folk artist Maud Lewis, seen here flowering as a painter while working as a housekeeper for the man she eventually married (a surly Ethan Hawke, in a role outside his usual wheelhouse). Aisling Walsh directs. ONCE UPON A TIME IN VENICE Venice Beach, that is, where a detective (Bruce Willis) goes ballistic after a dognapping leaves his beloved pooch in the hands of drug dealers. (That’s better than what happened to John Wick, who sprang into action after his dog was killed.) John Goodman, Jason Momoa, Kal Penn, Famke Janssen and Thomas Middleditch are along for the ride. Written and directed by Mark Cullen and Robb Cullen, who wrote the script for Kevin Smith’s Bruce Willis vehicle, “Cop Out.” PRAY FOR RAIN California’s drought is over; what better time to see it represented onscreen? A journalist (Annabelle Stephenson) raised in the state’s Central Valley goes home and learns that the lack of precipitation has turned the farms into a violent gangland. Jane Seymour plays her mother. ROUGH NIGHT In the midst of a coked-up bachelorette party, the women (Scarlett Johansson, Kate McKinnon, Jillian Bell, Ilana Glazer and Zoë Kravitz) must suddenly scramble after one of them accidentally kills a male stripper. The premise is strikingly similar to that of “Very Bad Things” (1998), which was, according to Janet Maslin in The New York Times, “about as funny as the character who winds up a double amputee.” Fear not: “Rough Night” comes from some of the talent behind “Broad City” — Lucia Aniello, who directed, and Paul W. Downs, with whom she wrote the script. SCORE: A FILM MUSIC DOCUMENTARY Going behind the scenes of how film scores are composed, this portrait of the craft features some of the most familiar “music by” credits in the business, including Hans Zimmer, John Williams, Danny Elfman, Quincy Jones, Rachel Portman and Thomas Newman. THE BAD BATCH Ana Lily Amirpour follows her breakout debut, the mysterious vampire tale “A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night,” with a dystopian free-for-all, starring Suki Waterhouse as a young woman who is banished to a desert overrun by cannibals and misfits. Jason Momoa, Keanu Reeves, Yolanda Ross and Giovanni Ribisi are among the outcasts. THE BEGUILED The gender politics of Don Siegel’s “The Beguiled” (1971), in which Clint Eastwood played a Union soldier holed up at a boarding school filled with temptresses, always seemed a bit reactionary. So it will be fascinating to see what Sofia Coppola does in this new version, which she adapted from the same Thomas Cullinan novel. Nicole Kidman, Elle Fanning, Kirsten Dunst and Angourie Rice (“The Nice Guys”) will torment Colin Farrell. THE BIG SICK Easily the breakout of Sundance, this mammoth crowd-pleaser finds the married screenwriters Emily V. Gordon and Kumail Nanjiani mining their own scary life experience for comedy. A Chicago comedian from a traditional Pakistani background (Mr. Nanjiani) and a grad student (Zoe Kazan) fall for each other, but just after their relationship hits the skids, she slips into a coma. He gets to know her parents (Holly Hunter and Ray Romano) during the prolonged uncertainty. Michael Showalter directs. GOOD FORTUNE John Paul DeJoria, a founder of the Paul Mitchell line of hair care products, gets a profile that emphasizes his rise from poverty and his belief in “conscious capitalism.” IN TRANSIT A founding figure of the direct-cinema movement, Albert Maysles died in 2015, shortly before this film’s premiere. His last feature observes the passengers on Amtrak’s Empire Builder route, which connects Chicago and the Pacific Northwest. Mr. Maysles directed with Lynn True, Nelson Walker, Ben Wu and David Usui. MY JOURNEY THROUGH FRENCH CINEMA Just as Martin Scorsese gave us “A Personal Journey With Martin Scorsese Through American Movies,” the French director Bertrand Tavernier (“’Round Midnight”) offers a guided tour of French cinema, from canonical classics to neglected figures. NOBODY SPEAK: TRIALS OF THE FREE PRESS Brian Knappenberger’s documentary promises the inside scoop on the Hulk Hogan lawsuit that led to Gawker’s bankruptcy, and on the broader implications for journalism. THE ORNITHOLOGIST The Portuguese director João Pedro Rodrigues (“To Die Like a Man”) continues to defy classification with this story of a bird-watcher (Paul Hamy) who sets off downstream on an isolated river and, on his journey, encounters increasingly strange company. Manohla Dargis called the movie, inspired by the story of St. Anthony, “the single most delightful and narratively adventurous movie I saw at Toronto” during its film festival. RIPPED After sampling a potent strain of marijuana said to be developed by the C.I.A., two stoners (Faizon Love and Russell Peters) awaken 30 years later, in 2016. TRANSFORMERS: THE LAST KNIGHT The case that Michael Bay is a covert abstract expressionist, taking millions of studio dollars and subversively using them to create symphonies of color and movement that no human eye could possibly be expected to follow, has not gained enough popular traction. Nominally, however, this is just another movie about giant robots. They are joined by Mark Wahlberg and Anthony Hopkins, who is new to the series. BABY DRIVER No one puts Baby in a corner — but this Baby (Ansel Elgort) happens to be a getaway driver who rocks out to his favorite tunes as he careens through city streets. Edgar Wright’s action comedy also stars Kevin Spacey, Lily James, Jamie Foxx, Jon Bernthal, Eiza González and Jon Hamm. The raves from South by Southwest were deafening. OKJA A young girl’s giant pachyderm-like animal friend falls into the clutches of a ruthless corporation headed by a showboating Tilda Swinton. An Seo Hyun stars alongside Jake Gyllenhaal, looking ready for a safari, in what promises to be a wild fantasy from the South Korean director Bong Joon-ho (“Snowpiercer”). POP AYE The first feature from the Singaporean filmmaker Kirsten Tan is set in Thailand, where an architect (Thaneth Warakulnukroh) reunites with an elephant he knew in his youth. And, of course, elephants never forget. He buys the animal and takes it on a road trip. AMITYVILLE: THE AWAKENING Yes, the asking price is probably quite low by now, but it’s still probably a bad idea to move your family into the haunted house that will forever be associated with Amityville, N.Y. Jennifer Jason Leigh, Bella Thorne, Cameron Monaghan and Mckenna Grace are the new occupants. THE B-SIDE: ELSA DORFMAN’S PORTRAIT PHOTOGRAPHY In a lighthearted change of pace from his interrogations of Donald H. Rumsfeld and Lynndie England, Errol Morris directed this profile of his fellow Cambridge, Mass., resident Elsa Dorfman, a portrait photographer and friend to Beat generation luminaries, who specializes in an obsolete medium: large-format Polaroid. DARKNESS RISING Nearly murdered as a child by her mother, a woman (Katrina Law) returns to the house where her mom went mad. It turns out to be an Overlook Hotel-type situation. DESPICABLE ME 3 Once a villain, still a curmudgeon, Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) matches wits with a bad guy (Trey Parker) who has a thing for ’80s fashion and music. There will be Minions, and also Kristen Wiig. THE HOUSE Two parents (Amy Poehler and Will Ferrell), unable to afford college tuition for their daughter (Ryan Simpkins), turn their home into a casino. Does what happens in the rec room stay in the rec room? With Allison Tolman from “Fargo” Season 1 and Jason Mantzoukas. INCONCEIVABLE A mother who is new to town (Nicky Whelan) is welcomed by a couple (Gina Gershon and Nicolas Cage). Then she grows too close. THE LITTLE HOURS Inspired by “The Decameron” — at least in the sense that “O Brother, Where Art Thou?” was inspired by “The Odyssey” — Jeff Baena’s shock comedy is centered on a group of medieval nuns (Aubrey Plaza, Alison Brie and Kate Micucci) who don’t have the usual compunctions about promiscuity or foul language. John C. Reilly, Jemima Kirke, Dave Franco and Fred Armisen are among the many familiar faces in the cast. THE SKYJACKER’S TALE On New Year’s Eve in 1984, Ishmael Muslim LaBeet, who had been convicted of murdering eight people in 1972 at a golf course in the Virgin Islands, hijacked an American Airlines flight on which he was being transferred as a prisoner. He made it to Cuba. This documentary promises his first interview since the hijacking (he’s now known as Ishmael Muslim Ali). 13 MINUTES The director Oliver Hirschbiegel already chronicled Hitler’s final days in “Downfall.” This biopic tells the story of Georg Elser (Christian Friedel), who made a failed assassination attempt on Hitler in 1939. AUSTIN FOUND In a plan that couldn’t possibly go awry, a woman craving celebrity (Linda Cardellini) plots to have her daughter kidnapped. CITY OF GHOSTS Matthew Heineman’s Oscar-nominated “Cartel Land” contrasted a vigilante border patrol in Arizona with a paramilitary organization in Mexico founded to beat back cartels. In “City of Ghosts,” Mr. Heineman travels to Syria to document yet another type of civilian activist group: The movie follows citizen journalists in Raqqa who risk death to document the Islamic State’s destruction of the city. A GHOST STORY The director David Lowery returns to indies after “Pete’s Dragon” with a film that’s more readily experienced than described; perhaps it’s best just to say that critics were entranced at Sundance. Rooney Mara and Casey Affleck (both from his “Ain’t Them Bodies Saints”) play a couple. There is a ghost (a sheet with cutout eyes) and a lengthy shot in which Ms. Mara eats almost a whole pie. PATTI CAKE$ A kindred spirit to the bus driver-poet in Jim Jarmusch’s “Paterson,” Patti (Danielle Macdonald) is an aspiring rapper stuck in a pocket of New Jersey. Geremy Jasper’s debut feature follows her efforts to make it big — and is enough of a crowd-pleaser that you may rap along with her. Bridget Everett, as Patti’s mother, and Cathy Moriarty (yes, from “Raging Bull”), as her grandmother, get in on the groove. SANTOALLA Some time after a Dutch couple moved to an isolated village in Spain, they came into a conflict with a neighboring family. One of the pair disappeared. This documentary from Andrew Becker and Daniel Mehrer investigates what happened. SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING No, Tobey Maguire isn’t in this one, and neither is Andrew Garfield. “Spider-Man: Homecoming” is a reboot of the series, starring Tom Holland — who played the role in “Captain America: Civil War” — as a young Peter Parker. Marisa Tomei plays Aunt May, and Robert Downey Jr. is Iron Man. Sony caught flak for its hiring of a relative rookie, Jon Watts (“Cop Car”), to direct, with critics saying that such opportunities are rarely accorded to women with comparable résumés. BRONX GOTHIC Andrew Rossi (“Page One: Inside The New York Times”) directs this film version of Okwui Okpokwasili’s one-woman show — a dance and performance piece inspired by her upbringing in the Bronx and centered on the rivalry between two girls on the cusp of adolescence. Reviewing a production in 2014, Rachel Saltz, writing in The Times, called Ms. Okpokwasili “a magnetic performer.” I AM THE BLUES Daniel Cross’s documentary tours blues country in Louisiana and Mississippi, and features interviews with musicians who are keeping the genre’s traditions alive, including Bobby Rush, Barbara Lynn and Little Freddie King. BATTLE SCARS Zane Holtz plays a veteran who returns from Afghanistan with post-traumatic stress disorder, with more violence — criminal and emotional — awaiting him at home. BLIND Alec Baldwin, as a novelist left blinded and widowed from a car accident, meets Demi Moore, who volunteers at a center for the sightless. She is unhappily married to a white-collar criminal (Dylan McDermott), and one thing leads to another. Please don’t let the title be a metaphor. CHASING CORAL In Jeff Orlowski’s “Chasing Ice,” a photographer documented the effects of global warming on glaciers. In “Chasing Coral,” a team sets out to capture time-lapse photographs that illustrate coral bleaching, another symptom of climate change that has potentially disastrous consequences for the planet. GRANNY OF THE DEAD In case “Shaun of the Dead” didn’t already milk the polite-British-zombies setup for all it was worth, this horror-comedy finds an Everyman (Marcus Carroll) saving a town from hordes of zombie senior citizens. LADY MACBETH This auspicious and thoroughly cinematic first feature from the British stage and opera director William Oldroyd transplants a Russian novella, “Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk,” to 19th-century England. A new bride (the fierce Florence Pugh), trapped in a sexless arranged marriage to an often-absent husband (Paul Hilton), begins an affair with a stable hand (Cosmo Jarvis). Together, they soon clarify the title’s reference to the Scottish play. WAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES The events of “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes” (2014) didn’t exactly restore harmony between humans and their evolutionary relatives. It’s time for war, and fearsome leaders head both species’ armies. On the ape side, Caesar (Andy Serkis). On the human side, the Colonel (Woody Harrelson). Matt Reeves, who did standout work in the previous installment, directed. WISH UPON An unhappy teenager (Joey King) has an opportunity to improve her life and get revenge on her bullies when she comes into possession of a wish-granting music box. Of course, there’s a catch. Directed by John R. Leonetti (“Annabelle”). AMNESIA Reports from Cannes 2015 indicate that this drama from Barbet Schroeder (“Reversal of Fortune”) is partly inspired by his mother. Marthe Keller plays a German woman living in Ibiza in the early 1990s. A friendship with a new neighbor (Max Riemelt) ultimately leads to questions about the past. Bruno Ganz also stars. DUNKIRK Christopher Nolan trades the cerebral for the visceral with this epic-scale restaging of the 1940 military actions in Dunkirk, France, which ended with the evacuation of more than 300,000 Allied troops from the French port town but endured as a kind of rallying cry for the British. The cast includes Kenneth Branagh, Cillian Murphy, Mark Rylance, Tom Hardy, Fionn Whitehead and, in his film acting debut, Harry Styles, formerly of One Direction. Mr. Nolan, perhaps Hollywood’s most outspoken advocate for the continued use of celluloid, shot the movie in a mixture of 70-millimeter IMAX and 65-millimeter, the gold standards for movies designed to be seen big. It will show in select theaters on film. FIRST KILL Hayden Christensen stars as a Wall Street broker who, with the best of intentions, takes his son (Ty Shelton) on a bonding trip. But the son is taken hostage by bank robbers, and his father must scramble to meet their demands. Bruce Willis plays a police chief. GIRLS TRIP Overdue for a reunion, four friends (Regina Hall, Jada Pinkett Smith, Queen Latifah and Tiffany Haddish) embark on a wild weekend excursion to New Orleans. Malcolm D. Lee (“Barbershop: The Next Cut”) directs. KILLING GROUND In a thriller from Australia, a camping couple encounter an empty tent and a child wandering without his parents. From the trailer, it looks as if they stumbled onto a crime in progress. LANDLINE Gillian Robespierre, reuniting with her “Obvious Child” star, Jenny Slate, directs this self-conscious throwback to a particular strain of New York dysfunctional-family comedy (there are shades of both “Hannah and Her Sisters” and “The Daytrippers”). Ms. Slate and Abby Quinn are sisters who suspect that their father (John Turturro) is cheating on their mother (Edie Falco). POLINA On the verge of joining the Bolshoi Ballet, a Russian dancer (Anastasia Shevtsova) instead travels to France, because who wouldn’t want Juliette Binoche as a choreographer? Valérie Müller and the choreographer Angelin Preljocaj (of Ballet Preljocaj) direct, working from the graphic novel by Bastien Vivès. VALERIAN AND THE CITY OF A THOUSAND PLANETS Twenty years after “The Fifth Element,” Luc Besson returns to flying cars and futuristic cities with this adaptation of the long-running French comic “Valérian and Laureline.” Dane DeHaan and Cara Delevingne play special agents. There are appearances by Rihanna and Herbie Hancock, along with Ethan Hawke, Rutger Hauer and Kris Wu. RUMBLE: THE INDIANS WHO ROCKED THE WORLD Catherine Bainbridge directs this documentary about the unsung influence that Native American musicians have had on rock and other popular music in the United States. ATOMIC BLONDE Charlize Theron’s Furiosa was a great action heroine, but could she beat her new character at bare-knuckle combat? Ms. Theron does what promises to be some dazzling stunt work as a British agent in Berlin at the end of the Cold War. The veteran stunt coordinator David Leitch (“John Wick”) directs, from the graphic novel “The Coldest City.” James McAvoy, John Goodman, Sofia Boutella and Toby Jones also star. BRIGSBY BEAR “Brigsby Bear” is the name of the TV show watched by only one person (Kyle Mooney), who lives in an underground bunker. But in movies, underground bunkers don’t stay bunked for long. Mr. Mooney and the director, Dave McCary, are “Saturday Night Live” collaborators. The cast also includes Mark Hamill, Jane Adams, Matt Walsh, Michaela Watkins, Ryan Simpkins and Greg Kinnear. THE EMOJI MOVIE An entire animated movie about emojis? ¯\_(<U+30C4>)_/¯ The voices include those of T. J. Miller, James Corden, Anna Faris, Maya Rudolph and Patrick Stewart. A FAMILY MAN A cutthroat headhunter (Gerard Butler) who’s competing with a colleague (Alison Brie) for a promotion finds his ambitions threatened when his son receives a cancer diagnosis. Not to be confused with the Brett Ratner film “The Family Man,” this drama also stars Gretchen Mol, Willem Dafoe and Alfred Molina. FROM THE LAND OF THE MOON The original title is “Mal de Pierres,” which is a very dignified-sounding way of saying “kidney stones.” These stones afflict Marion Cotillard, playing a sheltered and an unhappily married woman in 1950s France who, at a hospital in the Alps, falls for a wounded veteran (Louis Garrel). Nicole Garcia directs. IMPERFECTIONS An unsuccessful actress (Virginia Kull) is persuaded that the way to improve her cash flow is to rip off her mother’s boyfriend (Ed Begley Jr.), who works in Chicago’s Jewelers Row district. Marilu Henner, Ashton Holmes and Zach McGowan also star. AN INCONVENIENT SEQUEL: TRUTH TO POWER Al Gore offers a decade-later update to “An Inconvenient Truth.” Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenk’s sequel finds him once again on the lecture circuit (and frequently stepping away from PowerPoint, at the 2015 Paris climate conference and elsewhere) with reports on both what has changed for the worse and on opportunities for an energy revolution. THE LAST FACE Sean Penn directs this moony global wake-up call, which came in for a historic drubbing at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. (Even the opening title card — which needed a copy editor — was mocked.) Charlize Theron and Javier Bardem star as the planet’s best-looking humanitarian aide workers, who have a steamy affair against a backdrop of war and strife in Sierra Leone, South Sudan and Liberia. MENASHE Joshua Z. Weinstein shot this mostly Yiddish-language feature in Borough Park, in Brooklyn, using nonprofessional actors from the ultra-Orthodox area. Menashe Lustig plays the title character, whose wife’s death endangers his custody of his son (Ruben Niborski) — a rule in his Hasidic community requires a mother in every household. Over the course of a week, Menashe bonds with his boy. PERSON TO PERSON Shooting on 16-millimeter, Dustin Guy Defa directs this scrappy ensemble comedy set on a single day in New York. The cast includes Michael Cera, Abbi Jacobson, George Sample III, Tavi Gevinson and — stealing the show — the real-life vinyl enthusiast Bene Coopersmith, who is drawn in by the promise of a rare record. STRANGE WEATHER Holly Hunter plays a college administrator in Mississippi who finds out that a friend of her son, who committed suicide, has opened a restaurant chain based on his idea. Carrie Coon also stars. Katherine Dieckmann directs. BRAVE NEW JERSEY The residents of a small town in New Jersey tune into Orson Welles’s 1938 “War of the Worlds” broadcast — and like many who heard it live, they don’t realize that it’s theater. The fun cast includes Anna Camp, Heather Burns, Dan Bakkedahl and Raymond J. Barry. COLUMBUS It’s not about Christopher, or even Ohio, but Columbus, Ind., where a lifelong resident (Haley Lu Richardson) and a visitor (John Cho) walk and talk about life and modern architecture, for which the small city is a surprising haven. Michelle Forbes plays Ms. Richardson’s mother; Parker Posey and Rory Culkin also appear. Kogonada, a director who uses a single name, makes his feature debut. THE DARK TOWER Adapted from Stephen King’s “Dark Tower” series — seven novels and a short story published over three decades, inspired by Robert Browning, J. R. R. Tolkien and Sergio Leone — this adaptation casts Idris Elba as Roland Deschain, the last gunfighter in an alternate land, and Matthew McConaughey as the Man in Black, with whom he is in mythic conflict. Nikolaj Arcel (“A Royal Affair”) directs. DETROIT Just thinking about it gets the heart pounding: Kathryn Bigelow, the best action director in movies, reunites with her “Zero Dark Thirty” and “The Hurt Locker” screenwriter, the journalist Mark Boal, for an ensemble procedural set during the Detroit riots of 1967. The large cast includes John Boyega, Will Poulter, Algee Smith, Jacob Latimore, Jason Mitchell, Hannah Murray, Kaitlyn Dever, John Krasinski and Anthony Mackie. FUN MOM DINNER Four mothers (Toni Collette, Katie Aselton, Bridget Everett and Molly Shannon) of preschoolers assemble for what turns out to be a crazy yet heartwarming evening out. Directed by Alethea Jones and written by Julie Rudd, whose husband, Paul Rudd, appears as a kind of artisanal pot dealer. ICARUS Bryan Fogel decided to try a regimen of sports doping to learn about it and to see if he would get caught. He ended up in what are said to be explosive interactions with Grigory Rodchenkov, who helped facilitate one of sports’ most elaborate doping schemes. (Mr. Fogel helped arrange interviews with Mr. Rodchenkov for The New York Times’s prizewinning reports on doping.) INGRID GOES WEST An unbalanced loner with a few screws loose (Aubrey Plaza) becomes obsessed with a social media celebrity (Elizabeth Olsen) and worms her way into her life. It’s a dark comedy, not a stalker thriller. O’Shea Jackson Jr. and Wyatt Russell also star. IN THIS CORNER OF THE WORLD Based on a manga trilogy by Fumiyo Kouno, this anime centers on a woman who moves to a port city in Hiroshima Prefecture one year before the dropping of the bomb. Sunao Katabuchi directs. STEP Amanda Lipitz’s crowd-pleasing documentary follows several members of a high school step-dance team in Baltimore over the course of a year. They face social and economic obstacles amid dazzling dance numbers. WIND RIVER Taylor Sheridan, the screenwriter of “Sicario” and “Hell or High Water,” directs this murder mystery set on a remote, mountainous reservation in Wyoming. Jeremy Renner is a game tracker who teams up with an ill-prepared (yet consistently underestimated) F.B.I. agent (Elizabeth Olsen, in her second film of the week) to find out whodunit. AFTER LOVE No stranger to stories of domestic horror like “Our Children” (2013), the Belgian filmmaker Joachim Lafosse directs this fraught scenario about a couple (Cédric Kahn and Bérénice Bejo) who separate but continue living in the same apartment with their kids. MACHINES Rahul Jain’s documentary peers inside an Indian textile factory to show the squalor that lies behind the creation of gorgeous fabrics, and the people who create them under such conditions. ANNABELLE: CREATION A prequel to a spinoff: “Annabelle” (2014) was an offshoot of “The Conjuring” (2013), and this film concerns events before “Annabelle,” with presumably no connection to “The Conjuring 2” (2016). Got it? “Annabelle: Creation” tells the story of how one evil doll came to haunt so many movies. Talitha Bateman, Anthony LaPaglia and Miranda Otto star. David F. Sandberg (“Lights Out”) directs. JESÚS After committing an assault, a teenager (Nicolás Durán) in Santiago is forced to confront his father (Alejandro Goic) in a film inspired by a real-life hate crime in Chile in 2012. THE NUT JOB 2: NUTTY BY NATURE An animated squirrel with Will Arnett’s voice works with his animal friends to thwart the construction of an amusement park. THE ONLY LIVING BOY IN NEW YORK If the Simon & Garfunkel reference in the title weren’t enough, it sure sounds a bit like “The Graduate”: A newly minted college graduate (Callum Turner) contends with both the girl he’s wooing (Kiersey Clemons) and his father’s mistress (Kate Beckinsale), with whom he becomes infatuated. Marc Webb directs from a script by Allan Loeb (“Collateral Beauty”). Pierce Brosnan, Jeff Bridges and Cynthia Nixon are also in it. PILGRIMAGE Any new fans Tom Holland wins from “Spider-Man: Homecoming” can catch him here as a 13th-century monk on a dangerous mission to transport a holy relic to Rome. REALIVE The Spanish director Mateo Gil (who has collaborated with Alejandro Amenábar on scripts for films like “Open Your Eyes”) wrote and directed this science-fiction film about a man (Tom Hughes) with a terminal disease who is cryogenically frozen and then awakened in 2084 after 60 years of limbo. Charlotte Le Bon and Oona Chaplin co-star. THE TRIP TO SPAIN Having already test-run their mealtime banter in the north of England (“The Trip”) and Italy (“The Trip to Italy”), Rob Brydon and Steve Coogan eat and argue lavishly while touring the Iberian Peninsula. Michael Winterbottom directs, again. WHOSE STREETS? Sabaah Folayan and Damon Davis’s documentary, acclaimed at Sundance for its immediacy, captures the anger of residents and activists in Ferguson, Mo., in the wake of the killing of an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown, by a white police officer. THE BATTLESHIP ISLAND Scheduled for release on South Korea’s Independence Day, this World War II drama concerns an escape plot for 400 Koreans forced into labor during the Japanese occupation. Ryoo Seung-wan directs. THE WOUND A factory worker from Queenstown, South Africa, takes a boy from Johannesburg under his wing as part of a Xhosa initiation ritual. When the movie showed at this year’s New Directors/New Films Festival, A. O. Scott called it “affecting and suspenseful even as it hits a few predictable beats.” THE HITMAN’S BODYGUARD A renowned bodyguard (Ryan Reynolds) takes on the unenviable task of chaperoning the world’s most wanted hitman (Samuel L. Jackson), who has been his enemy in the past. Even the advertising materials for this buddy comedy mercilessly parody the 1992 Whitney Houston vehicle “The Bodyguard.” LEMON This year’s designated Sundance squirm comedy stars Brett Gelman (who wrote the script with his wife, the film’s director, Janicza Bravo) as a 40-year-old drama teacher who alienates everyone around him. Judy Greer, Michael Cera and Gillian Jacobs endure his disagreeable behavior. LOGAN LUCKY It seems rumors of Steven Soderbergh’s retirement from movies have been greatly exaggerated. (He has often been somewhat coy when asked about those rumors in interviews.) And as good as “The Knick” was, it’ll be nice to have him back on the big screen. Channing Tatum and Adam Driver play brothers who plot a robbery at a speedway. Many others are involved: Riley Keough, Hilary Swank, Seth MacFarlane, Katie Holmes, Daniel Craig and Katherine Waterston. BEACH RATS Eliza Hittman’s well-regarded feature debut, “It Felt Like Love,” dealt with a Brooklyn teenage girl’s sexual awakening. “Beach Rats” is in some ways a male companion piece, about a teenager (Harris Dickinson) struggling with “emotional, sexual and ethical confusion,” A. O. Scott wrote when it showed as the centerpiece of New Directors/New Films. BUSHWICK Shot almost entirely in a (fake) single take, this crafty action thriller follows a young woman (Brittany Snow) and a resourceful veteran (Dave Bautista) as they navigate the violent, mercenary streets of Brooklyn, torn apart after secessionists from Texas start a civil war. That’s one way to reverse gentrification. DEATH NOTE Imagine a notebook, and anyone whose name is written in that notebook will die. The premise comes from a manga by Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata. Lakeith Stanfield, Nat Wolff and Margaret Qualley star. The director, Adam Wingard, here completes an arc of the modern movie business, having moved from indie horror (“A Horrible Way to Die”) to horror reboots (“Blair Witch”) to Netflix. GOTTI John Gotti, the crime boss and “first media don,” was already the focus of a 1996 TV movie, in which he was played by Armand Assante. In this theatrical film, which covers 30 years in his life, John Travolta assumes impersonation duties, as he did for Robert Shapiro. Mr. Travolta’s wife, Kelly Preston, plays Gotti’s. The screenwriters are Lem Dobbs (“The Limey”) and the character actor Leo Rossi. HEARTSTONE It’s summer in Iceland, and while one teenage boy chases a girl, another begins to fall for that boy, his longtime best friend. Gudmundur Arnar Gudmundsson directs. POLAROID What “The Ring” was to VHS tapes, this movie is to Polaroid photographs. Must horror movies ruin all of our favorite obsolete technologies? TULIP FEVER Demand accountability from Oscar bloggers, who once proclaimed this much-delayed release, adapted from the novel by Deborah Moggach, a heavyweight. Alicia Vikander, as a 17th-century woman unhappily in an arranged marriage (with Christoph Waltz), has an affair with a painter (Dane DeHaan). Together, they enter the Dutch tulip market hoping to strike it rich. That bubble didn’t work out, but maybe these crazy kids will be O.K.? Justin Chadwick (“The Other Boleyn Girl”) directs from a script by Tom Stoppard. THE UNKNOWN GIRL Since “Rosetta,” the movies of the Belgian brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne have shown the strong influence of the French director Robert Bresson. In some ways, their latest puts a modern spin on Bresson’s “Diary of a Country Priest”: A doctor (Adèle Haenel) declines to answer a ringing doorbell after hours; when the person doing the ringing is found dead, she sets out to learn more about her — and to find a shred of decency in a sinning world. Jérémie Renier and Olivier Gourmet, Dardennes regulars, are also in the cast. UNLEASHED An app designer (Kate Micucci) moves to San Francisco to get away from her treacherous boyfriend — which sounds like a good plan, but then a full moon turns her beloved cat and dog into men. Drat. WILD Ill at ease with civilized life, Ania (Lilith Stangenberg) forges what becomes an increasingly close and physical bond with a wolf. If festival reviews are any indication, the film is poised somewhere between a tall tale and a provocative social commentary. Nicolette Krebitz wrote and directed. LEAP! A girl who longs to become a dancer and a boy who longs to become an inventor head to Paris to pursue their passions in this animated feature. With the voices of Elle Fanning, Nat Wolff, Kate McKinnon, Maddie Ziegler, Carly Rae Jepsen and Mel Brooks. THE TEACHER Possibly the most imported Czech filmmaker on the current American art house scene, Jan Hrebejk (“Divided We Fall,” working with his usual writing collaborator, Petr Jarchovsky) directed this satire of Communist Czechoslovakia in the 1980s. Zuzana Maurery plays a teacher whose seemingly innocuous question to new students — what do your parents do? — is part of a bartering strategy. DOLORES Peter Bratt’s documentary is an ode to Dolores Huerta, who founded the National Farm Workers Association with Cesar Chavez but is perhaps not as remembered as he is. Ms. Huerta herself is interviewed at length. FALLEN There are no more “Twilight” books to adapt, but Hollywood’s hunger for supernatural young-adult romances is eternal. So here is the first film from Lauren Kate’s best-selling series about a girl at a reform school (Hermione Corfield) who is watched over by a hunky angel (Jeremy Irvine). Lola Kirke also stars. Scott Hicks (who once made “Shine”) directs. THE LAYOVER Stranded at the St. Louis airport after a flight diversion, two friends (Alexandra Daddario and Kate Upton) vie for the affections of the same man (Matt Barr). William H. Macy, who is also in the film, directs this comedy from a script by David Hornsby (“It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia”) and Lance Krall. TROPHY The documentary filmmaker Shaul Schwarz (“Narco Cultura”), directing with Christina Clusiau, looks at the economics surrounding one of the ultimate scarce commodities: endangered species. Hunters and breeders alike discuss putting a price tag on rare animals. UNLOCKED In an espionage thriller from Michael Apted, Noomi Rapace plays a C.I.A. agent who is on the run and working to stop a terrorist attack in London. Orlando Bloom, Michael Douglas, Toni Collette and John Malkovich are also in the film, but who knows whose side they’re on?  Compiled with the assistance of Suzanne O’Connor.","dates subject change drowning independent filmmaker experimental streak bette gordon credits include variety riff vertigo directs thriller centered

"The Doctor Versus the Denier","WASHINGTON — Never mind Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. You want to see a real can’t-look-away train wreck of a relationship? Look to the nation’s capital, where a messy falling out is chronicled everywhere from the tabloids to a glossy fashion magazine, replete with a photo shoot by a swimming pool. The saga has enough betrayal, backstabbing, recrimination, indignation and ostracization to impress Edith Wharton. The press breathlessly covers how much time has passed since the pair last spoke, whether they’re headed for splitsville, and if they can ever agree on what’s best for the children. It was always bound to be tempestuous because they are the ultimate odd couple, the doctor and the president. One is a champion of truth and facts. The other is a master of deceit and denial. One is highly disciplined, working 18-hour days. The other can’t be bothered to do his homework and golfs instead. One is driven by science and the public good. The other is a public menace, driven by greed and ego. One is a Washington institution. The other was sent here to destroy Washington institutions. One is incorruptible. The other corrupts. One is apolitical. The other politicizes everything he touches — toilets, windows, beans and, most fatally, masks. After a fractious week, when the former reality-show star in the White House retweeted a former game-show host saying that we shouldn’t trust doctors about Covid-19, Donald Trump and Anthony Fauci are gritting their teeth. What’s so scary is that the bumpy course of their relationship has life-or-death consequences for Americans. Who could even dream up a scenario where a president and a White House drop oppo research on the esteemed scientist charged with keeping us safe in a worsening pandemic? The administration acted like Peter Navarro, Trump’s wacko-bird trade adviser, had gone rogue when he assailed Dr. Fauci for being Dr. Wrong, in a USA Today op-ed. But does anyone believe that? And if he did, would he still have his job? No doubt it was a case of Trump murmuring: Will no one rid me of this meddlesome infectious disease specialist? Republicans on Capitol Hill privately confessed they were baffled by the whole thing, saying they couldn’t understand why Trump would undermine Fauci, especially now with the virus resurgent. They think it’s not only hurting Trump’s re-election chances, but theirs, too. As though it couldn’t get more absurd, Kellyanne Conway told Fox News on Friday that she thinks it would help Trump’s poll numbers for him to start giving public briefings on the virus again — even though that exercise went off the rails when the president began suggesting people inject themselves with bleach. “How did we get to a situation in our country where the public health official most known for honesty and hard work is most vilified for it?” marvels Michael Specter, a science writer for The New Yorker who began covering Fauci during the AIDs crisis. “And as Team Trump trashes him, the numbers keep horrifyingly proving him right.” When Dr. Fauci began treating AIDs patients, nearly every one of them died. “It was the darkest time of my life,” he told Specter. In an open letter, Larry Kramer called Fauci a “murderer.” Then, as Specter writes, he started listening to activists and made a rare admission: His approach wasn’t working. He threw his caution to the winds and became a public-health activist. Through rigorous research and commitment to clinical studies, the death rate from AIDs has plummeted over the years. Now Fauci struggles to drive the data bus as the White House throws nails under his tires. It seems emblematic of a deeper, existential problem: America has lost its can-do spirit. We were always Bugs Bunny, faster, smarter, more wily than everybody else. Now we’re Slugs Bunny. Can our country be any more pathetic than this: The Georgia governor suing the Atlanta mayor and City Council to block their mandate for city residents to wear masks? Trump promised the A team, but he has surrounded himself with losers and kiss-ups and second-raters. Just your basic Ayn Rand nightmare. Certainly, Dr. Fauci has had to adjust some of his early positions as he learned about this confounding virus. (“When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?” John Maynard Keynes wisely observed.) “Medicine is not an exact art,” Jerome Groopman, the best-selling author and professor at Harvard Medical School, put it. “There’s lots of uncertainty, always evolving information, much room for doubt. The most dangerous people are the ones who speak with total authority and no room for error.” Sound like someone you know? “Medical schools,” Dr. Groopman continued, “have curricula now to teach students the imperative of admitting when something went wrong, taking responsibility, and committing to righting it.” Some are saying the 79-year-old Dr. Fauci should say to hell with it and quit. But we need his voice of reason in this nuthouse of a White House. Despite Dr. Fauci’s best efforts to stay apolitical, he has been sucked into the demented political kaleidoscope through which we view everything now. Consider the shoot by his pool, photographed by Frankie Alduino, for a digital cover story by Norah O’Donnell for InStyle magazine. From the left, the picture represented an unflappable hero, exhausted and desperately in need of some R & R, chilling poolside, not letting the White House’s slime campaign get him down or silence him. And on the right, some saw a liberal media darling, high on his own supply in the midst of a deadly pandemic. “While America burns, Fauci does fashion mag photo shoots,” tweeted Sean Davis, co-founder of the right-wing website The Federalist. It’s no coincidence that the QAnon-adjacent cultists on the right began circulating a new conspiracy theory in the fever swamps of Facebook that Dr. Fauci’s wife of three and a half decades, a bioethicist, is Ghislaine Maxwell’s sister. (Do I need to tell you she isn’t?) Worryingly, new polls show that the smear from Trumpworld may be starting to stick; fewer Republicans trust the doctor now than in the spring. Forget Mueller, Sessions, Comey, Canada, his niece, Mika Brzezinski. Of the many quarrels, scrapes and scraps Trump has instigated in his time in office, surely this will be remembered not only as the most needless and perverse, but as the most dangerous. As Dr. Fauci told The Atlantic, it’s “a bit bizarre.” More than a bit, actually. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

"The Glare Varies for Two Actors on Hollywood’s Awards Trail","LOS ANGELES — This was supposed to be the awards season when Hollywood, having been scorched by consecutive #OscarsSoWhite years, avoided tumult over race. Not so. In heated conversations in Hollywood in recent weeks, prompted by articles on websites like The Daily Beast, Mic and ThinkProgress, producers, publicists, studio executives and other movie insiders have been grappling with whether there is a double standard at play — involving race, power or both — in the treatment of Nate Parker, a relatively unknown artist who has been sidelined as an Academy Award candidate, and Casey Affleck, the brother of moviedom royalty who is being feted as the leading contender for best actor. Mr. Parker, the force behind the slave-revolt film “The Birth of a Nation,” faced intense scrutiny in August, including from The New York Times, when new details surfaced concerning a case in which he was accused — and later acquitted — of raping a fellow student while at Penn State nearly two decades ago. The media storm, made worse by several contentious interviews given by Mr. Parker, 37, resulted in a poor performance at the box office for his film and its shunning on the seasonal awards circuit. While heralded at festivals, the film received mixed reviews upon release. Mr. Affleck, 41, has not received similar scrutiny over two sexual harassment suits that were filed against him by two women in 2010 in civil court. At the time, a lawyer for Mr. Affleck, who plays a sorrowful New England handyman in the celebrated drama “Manchester by the Sea,” denied the accusations as “desperate, fabricated claims” and called them an “extortion tactic.” Nothing was proved. Ultimately, he settled for undisclosed sums. Mr. Affleck’s performance has continued to rack up accolades, despite fresh attention on the 2010 lawsuits by the news media. (Asked about them by The Times for an article in November, he responded: “It was settled to the satisfaction of all. I was hurt and upset — I am sure all were — but I am over it.”) More than two dozen critics’ groups and festivals have named him best actor for his “Manchester by the Sea” performance. He is up for a Golden Globe on Sunday and a Screen Actors Guild award on Jan. 29. Why do the two men find themselves in much different circumstances? Perhaps people think Mr. Affleck’s performance, and the movie in which he stars, is better. Maybe it’s because, as an Oscar nominee and the brother of the box-office star Ben Affleck, Mr. Affleck has attained a privileged status in Hollywood; the power surrounding him may make people reluctant to openly criticize him. Certainly a factor is the fact that there was unsettling new information revealed about Mr. Parker’s rape case in August — that his accuser later committed suicide — while there have been no new disclosures regarding Mr. Affleck’s cases. Or maybe, say those mindful of Hollywood’s checkered racial history, it is because Mr. Affleck is white and Mr. Parker is black. Jeannie Suk Gersen, a professor at Harvard Law School who teaches criminal law and sexual harassment law, said the reason could be far simpler: Mr. Parker’s case was criminal and Mr. Affleck’s was civil. “People carelessly conflate rape with the entire range of sexual misconduct that can occur,” Ms. Suk Gersen said. “It’s all repulsive. But both morally and legally there are distinctions — degrees of behavior. Parker was accused of something far more serious.” (Ms. Suk Gersen is particularly attuned to Mr. Parker’s case, having contributed an article in September to The New Yorker, “The Public Trial of Nate Parker.”) Mr. Parker was acquitted by a jury. Mr. Affleck settled the civil sexual harassment lawsuits filed against him, something that his detractors have seized upon as tantamount to an acknowledgment of guilt. “As a lawyer, I don’t take a settlement to mean much of anything,” Ms. Suk Gersen said. “Sometimes it means guilt. But sometimes people who are innocent — especially celebrities — settle cases after doing a cost-benefit analysis: How much do I want to pay for this to be over?” One of the women, a producer named Amanda White, said in her complaint against Mr. Affleck that she endured “uninvited and unwelcome sexual advances” on the set of the film “I’m Still Here,” which he directed. The other woman, the cinematographer Magdalena Gorka, accused Mr. Affleck of curling up next to her while she was sleeping and “caressing her back.” (The women and their shared lawyer declined requests to comment for this article.) Even so, there are people in Hollywood — none of whom would speak on the record — who believe that Mr. Affleck is insulated because he is a white man. Their feeling is that the entertainment-industry awards groups, still largely dominated by white men, are judging him differently than they judged Mr. Parker. That sentiment has also appeared on social media. “The racial inequality between Affleck/Parker cases disgusts me,” Julia Campanelli, an actress, said recently in an unsolicited Twitter message to a Times reporter. Mr. Affleck’s supporters and even some people who worked with Mr. Parker to promote “The Birth of a Nation” believe that comparing the two men is absurd — the definition of false equivalency, or when each side of a debate is presented as equally credible, even when the factual evidence is stacked heavily on one side. While refusing to speak publicly because they did not want to add momentum to the discussion, two studio executives wondered if the negative attention on Mr. Affleck is an example of negative whisper campaigning by Oscar rivals. Mr. Parker declined an interview request. A spokeswoman for Mr. Affleck declined to comment. The friction surrounding Mr. Affleck comes amid heightened attention on misconduct against women by men in the entertainment industry, including Bill Cosby, who is facing a June criminal trial on charges of aggravated indecent assault, and Johnny Depp, who was accused of domestic violence in May. (A restraining order against Mr. Depp, requested by his ex-wife Amber Heard, was later dismissed with prejudice.) In December, a new round of outrage erupted over the treatment of Maria Schneider by Bernardo Bertolucci and Marlon Brando on the set of “Last Tango in Paris,” which was released in 1972. The awards season currently underway includes other questions about whether voters can — or should — separate art from the artist. Mel Gibson, for instance, became a Hollywood pariah in 2006, when he was charged with drunken driving and went on an anti-Semitic tirade. In 2011, he pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge of battering a former girlfriend. But Mr. Gibson’s “Hacksaw Ridge,” a war drama, is now vying for awards. He is expected to attend the Golden Globes, where “Hacksaw Ridge” is up for three honors, including best director and best picture. This was meant to be the Oscar contest that soothed Hollywood’s racial divide. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, responding to protests over two straight years of awards nominations for only white actors, implemented substantial changes last year to its voting requirements, recruiting process and governing structure. At the same time, studios pushed forward films with diverse casts, including “Fences,” “Hidden Figures,” “Loving” and “Moonlight” — all of which are expected to contend for prizes, some in multiple categories, at the 89th Academy Awards in February. Nominations will be announced on Jan. 24.","los angeles supposed awards season hollywood scorched consecutive oscarssowhite avoided tumult race heated conversations hollywood recent weeks prompted articles websites daily beast mic thinkprogress producers publicists studio executives movie insiders grappling double standard play involving race power treatment nate parker unknown artist sidelined academy award candidate casey affleck brother moviedom royalty feted leading contender actor parker force slave revolt film birth nation faced intense scrutiny august including york times details surfaced accused acquitted raping fellow student penn decades ago media storm worse contentious interviews parker resulted poor performance box office film shunning seasonal awards circuit heralded festivals film received mixed reviews release affleck received similar scrutiny sexual harassment suits filed women civil court time lawyer affleck plays sorrowful england handyman celebrated drama manchester sea denied accusations desperate fabricated claims called extortion tactic proved ultimately settled undisclosed sums affleck performance continued rack accolades fresh attention lawsuits news media times article november responded settled satisfaction hurt upset dozen critics festivals named actor manchester sea performance golden globe sunday screen actors guild award jan circumstances people affleck performance movie stars oscar nominee brother box office star ben affleck affleck attained privileged status hollywood power surrounding people reluctant openly criticize factor unsettling information revealed parker rape august accuser committed suicide disclosures affleck mindful hollywood checkered racial history affleck white parker black jeannie suk gersen professor harvard law school teaches criminal law sexual harassment law reason simpler parker criminal affleck civil people carelessly conflate rape entire range sexual misconduct occur ms suk gersen repulsive morally legally distinctions degrees behavior parker accused ms suk gersen attuned parker contributed article september yorker public trial nate parker parker acquitted jury affleck settled civil sexual harassment lawsuits filed detractors seized tantamount acknowledgment guilt lawyer don settlement ms suk gersen means guilt people innocent celebrities settle cost benefit analysis pay women producer named amanda white complaint affleck endured uninvited unwelcome sexual advances set film directed woman cinematographer magdalena gorka accused affleck curling sleeping caressing women shared lawyer declined requests comment article people hollywood speak record affleck insulated white feeling entertainment industry awards dominated white judging judged parker sentiment appeared social media racial inequality affleck parker disgusts julia campanelli actress recently unsolicited twitter message times reporter affleck supporters people parker promote birth nation comparing absurd definition false equivalency debate equally credible factual evidence stacked heavily refusing speak publicly add momentum discussion studio executives wondered negative attention affleck negative whisper campaigning oscar rivals parker declined interview request spokeswoman affleck declined comment friction surrounding affleck amid heightened attention misconduct women entertainment industry including bill cosby facing june criminal trial charges aggravated indecent assault johnny depp accused domestic violence restraining depp requested wife amber heard dismissed prejudice december round outrage erupted treatment maria schneider bernardo bertolucci marlon brando set tango paris released awards season underway includes questions voters separate art artist mel gibson instance hollywood pariah charged drunken driving anti semitic tirade pleaded contest misdemeanor charge battering girlfriend gibson hacksaw ridge war drama vying awards expected attend golden globes hacksaw ridge honors including director picture meant oscar contest soothed hollywood racial divide academy motion picture arts sciences responding protests straight awards nominations white actors implemented substantial voting requirements recruiting process governing structure time studios pushed forward films diverse casts including fences hidden figures loving moonlight expected contend prizes multiple categories th academy awards february nominations announced jan"
"When Dog Owners Are Off the Leash","I don’t identify with celebrities, especially ones with superstar husbands. But when Amber Heard, the actress, got caught last spring, I felt her pain. She has been ordered to appear in court next year, the BBC recently reported, for smuggling two Yorkshire terriers into Australia. Ms. Heard, the wife of Johnny Depp (who was in Australia to film another “Pirates of the Caribbean” movie), neglected to declare the couple’s two dogs upon arrival by private jet at Brisbane. Unlike actors and tourists, dogs traveling from the United States must spend 10 days in quarantine. The incident gained attention when Australia’s agriculture minister threatened to put down the dogs (named Pistol and Boo) if they were not removed from the country. He had seen them when a groomer posted a photo on Facebook, and in a TV interview said he did not care that Mr. Depp had been voted the sexiest man alive; he still had to follow quarantine rules. The tabloids have dubbed the ongoing canine kerfuffle “the war on terrier.” I deem it newsworthy only because a nervy dog owner finally was caught. These days half the people I know, myself included, are sneaking their dogs everywhere. I know one couple who take their undeclared Norwich terrier into France with as much thought as they would give carrying a loaf of bread out of a boulangerie, and another who sneak their Brussels griffon into Mexico, where I’ve seen them frolicking on the beach in Tulum. In this world of the privileged who won’t take no for an answer and will take pets everywhere, we sneak them onto flights to avoid steep fees and into hotels to do the same. And sometimes we sneak them into hotels that don’t allow dogs at all. We sneak them into restaurants, too, often by providing questionable letters from therapists or Internet outfits saying the animals offer us emotional support for anxiety disorders. And we keep getting away with it because laws are just unclear enough to intimidate anyone who questions a disability. Never mind that misrepresenting our pets as service animals (when, like mine, they don’t always behave like them) makes life more difficult for those who really need them. “Is that a service animal?” I heard a hostess ask a very healthy-looking young couple the other night as they entered a TriBeCa pub with a big black dog. They pulled out a letter, showed it, got the O.K. and proceeded to walk the dog through the restaurant as if they were on a sidewalk. I marveled at the nerve, although I myself have a letter from a psychologist that says I have a panic disorder and suffer from fear of crowds, and that my dog allays my symptoms. Making matters worse (or better, depending on your point of view), United Airlines recently placed “comfort dogs” in seven airports “to help take some of the stress out of holiday travel for our customers.” (Another way to do that would be to stop charging $150 each way to have a small dog in a carrier bag under the seat.) It’s no wonder passengers like me are playing the emotional-support-animal game, although I’m not sure that entitles us to shamelessly walk our dogs around the airport as if they were no different than children with interesting haircuts. All of this is nothing new, even as it has become more common. To avoid having their four dogs set foot on English soil, which required a six-month quarantine, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton lived on a yacht while he was filming a movie in the 1970s. Several decades later, the quarantine in Britain was lifted in time for the 2012 Olympic Summer Games. As goes the British government, so go all kinds of luxury hotels. After a recent premiere of his short film celebrating the new “open pet policy” at the W Hotel Times Square, Alan Cumming told The New York Post he can now sit at the bar with his dog. And this year, guests at the Standard no longer have to be sneaks to avoid a pet fee. An article on the hotel’s website featuring Anjelica Huston posing on a bed with several dogs announces that two per guest are welcome free. Children, on the other hand, are (without irony) prohibited. “They don’t ask questions,” Ms. Huston says of dogs in her interview. “They just understand the answers.” In other news, Amtrak, after a decades-long pets ban, has started allowing small cats and dogs on trains. Representative Jeff Denham, a California Republican, set things in motion when he realized he couldn’t ride with his French bulldog, Lily. “We are always looking for ways to enhance the passenger experience,” an Amtrak spokesperson told The Washington Post. If only they had thought of that for the two years my husband and I were shuttling back and forth between New York and Washington for his job. Our options were either sneaking our longhaired miniature dachshund onto an insufferably slow bus, which was harrowing given her tendency to want to get out of her bag. Or we had to sneak her onto flights to avoid the outrageous fees that cost as much as our airfare. At least we had the perfect accessory for the crime: a small perforated black shoulder bag that looked more like a Chanel knockoff than a pet carrier. For a person who was annoyed by the entitlement of dog owners up until the moment I got one myself, I’ve become more cavalier than a Cavalier King Charles spaniel. I’ve taken my dog to restaurants, concerts, barbershops, tailors and therapy, where it is always noted that the dog’s name, Zoloft, is metaphorically, if not clinically, appropriate. Recently, when invited at the last minute to participate in a group reading in Miami, I brought Zoloft onto the stage and offended both audience and participants by inadvertently distracting the viewers from the readers. “It’s a well-known rule,” one participant said, “that dogs and children always upstage adults in performances.” It was a smack on the snout but also a wake-up call. Those with objections are biting back more, it seems. When The New York Times published an article about pet travel, there was a barrage of comments from allergy sufferers and people who did not want to share space with someone’s “fur child” as we who are obsessed call them. And now organizations like the Board of Guide Dogs for the Blind, a California group, and Canine Companions for Independence are taking up the issue of dubious service-dog designations by pushing the Department of Justice to regulate the sale of service animal equipment and IDs. As for Amber Heard, when she was caught last spring, she vowed never to return to Australia. That’s not possible because she is expected at her trial next year. Every dog has its day. And sometimes sneaky celebrities get their due.","don identify celebrities superstar husbands amber heard actress caught spring pain court bbc recently reported smuggling yorkshire terriers australia ms heard wife johnny depp australia film pirates caribbean movie neglected declare couple dogs arrival private jet brisbane unlike actors tourists dogs traveling united spend days quarantine incident gained attention australia agriculture minister threatened dogs named pistol boo removed country groomer posted photo facebook tv interview care depp voted sexiest alive follow quarantine rules tabloids dubbed ongoing canine kerfuffle war terrier deem newsworthy nervy dog owner finally caught days half people included sneaking dogs couple undeclared norwich terrier france carrying loaf bread boulangerie sneak brussels griffon mexico ve frolicking beach tulum world privileged won answer pets sneak flights avoid steep fees hotels sneak hotels don dogs sneak restaurants providing questionable letters therapists internet outfits animals offer emotional support anxiety disorders laws unclear intimidate questions disability mind misrepresenting pets service animals mine don behave makes life difficult service animal heard hostess healthy couple night entered tribeca pub black dog pulled letter proceeded walk dog restaurant sidewalk marveled nerve letter psychologist panic disorder suffer fear crowds dog allays symptoms matters worse depending view united airlines recently comfort dogs airports stress holiday travel customers stop charging $ dog carrier bag seat passengers playing emotional support animal game entitles shamelessly walk dogs airport children haircuts common avoid dogs set foot english soil required month quarantine elizabeth taylor richard burton lived yacht filming movie s decades quarantine britain lifted time olympic summer games british government kinds luxury hotels recent premiere short film celebrating pet policy hotel times square alan cumming told york post sit bar dog guests standard sneaks avoid pet fee article hotel website featuring anjelica huston posing bed dogs announces guest free children hand irony prohibited don questions ms huston dogs interview understand answers news amtrak decades pets ban started allowing cats dogs trains representative jeff denham california republican set motion realized couldn ride french bulldog lily enhance passenger experience amtrak spokesperson told washington post husband shuttling york washington job options sneaking longhaired miniature dachshund insufferably slow bus harrowing tendency bag sneak flights avoid outrageous fees cost airfare perfect accessory crime perforated black shoulder bag looked chanel knockoff pet carrier person annoyed entitlement dog owners moment ve cavalier cavalier king charles spaniel ve dog restaurants concerts barbershops tailors therapy noted dog zoloft metaphorically clinically recently invited minute participate reading miami brought zoloft stage offended audience participants inadvertently distracting viewers readers rule participant dogs children upstage adults performances smack snout wake call objections biting york times published article pet travel barrage comments allergy sufferers people share space fur child obsessed call organizations board guide dogs blind california canine companions independence taking issue dubious service dog designations pushing department justice regulate sale service animal equipment ids amber heard caught spring vowed return australia expected trial dog day sneaky celebrities due"
"Winona Ryder, an Emblem of ’90s Cool, Grows Up","LOS ANGELES — In an early episode of the new Netflix supernatural drama “Stranger Things,” a single mother played by Winona Ryder sits in a cubby hole communicating with her youngest son through a tangled ball of blinking Christmas lights. He has vanished under mysterious circumstances. To better understand how to sell such a strange, emotional moment, Ms. Ryder looked no further than her own mother, Cynthia Palmer. “I don’t have kids, so my mom helped me a lot on this,” Ms. Ryder, 44, said while sitting on a big leather couch at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel here, dressed in black jeans and a faded Leonard Cohen T-shirt she bought at a concert in 1988. “I’d call her sometimes and say: ‘Mom, what would you do if every indication is that your child is dead, but you believe that lights are telling you that he isn’t?’ And she’d say: ‘Honey, I’d totally believe that. It’s primal.’” The pint-size Ms. Ryder storms through “Stranger Things” (available for streaming on July 15), generating what Matt and Ross Duffer, the twins who created the series, described as an essential “Winona-ness,” an air of fragility and feisty determination. “She has a very intense energy about her, Winona does, a wiry unpredictability, a sort of anxiousness that we thought we’d really lean into,” Matt Duffer said about what inspired the brothers to incorporate some of Ms. Ryder’s traits. Back in the late ’80s and through much of the ’90s, Ms. Ryder, whose godfather was the LSD enthusiast Timothy Leary, was a sort of emblem of cool: dating Johnny Depp and the Soul Asylum frontman Dave Pirner and inspiring an ’80s punk band to call itself the Wynona Riders. According to the Duffers, 32, online reaction to the trailer for “Stranger Things,” which is set in the ’80s, revealed a deep nostalgia for Ms. Ryder. “It’s the Winona Forever fans, there’s just a lot of them,” Matt Duffer said. “She’s such an icon. She certainly hasn’t been forgotten.” He rattled off some of Ms. Ryder’s greatest hits, including two of Tim Burton’s films, “Beetlejuice” and “Edward Scissorhands.” “We grew up on her movies. We were hoping that if we wanted so desperately to see her onscreen that other people would feel that, too.” As youthful as Ms. Ryder looks, this isn’t the first mother she has played. (In J.J. Abrams’s 2009 “Star Trek” reboot, for example, she had a cameo as Spock’s mom.) But what “Stranger Things” did offer was a leading role with nuance and dimension. “I get sent a lot of scripts where you’re just the mom,” Ms. Ryder said, demonstrating the ancillarity of the roles by putting her hands on her hips, tilting her head and announcing sternly, “C’mon, kids!” “And you think, could I do something with this? Is there a way to make this interesting? But in the end you think, no.” In her heyday, it would have been difficult to imagine Ms. Ryder, a two-time Oscar nominee, having to weigh such flimsy options. Though she made her feature film debut at 15, in “Lucas,” it was her first truly starring role in the 1989 dark comedy “Heathers,” as a popular girl who decides to radically upend the high school pecking order, that kicked off her long winning streak. Over the next decade, she seemed to be everywhere, from indie gems like Jim Jarmusch’s “Night on Earth” to Woody Allen’s “Celebrity” to Martin Scorsese’s 19th-century period drama “The Age of Innocence.” Then in 2001, Ms. Ryder was arrested in a shoplifting case and later convicted of taking an estimated $5,500 worth of designer goods from Saks Fifth Avenue in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was also in possession of eight pharmaceutical drugs including Demerol, Vicodin and Percodan. She was sentenced to three years’ probation, drug counseling and 480 hours of community service. Though she continued to work, Ms. Ryder disappeared from the spotlight. As humiliating as it must have been back then — the store’s surveillance footage is a well-watched clip on YouTube — there’s a feeling now that Ms. Ryder has discovered a silver lining. “I think for me, personally, it was good for my soul and stuff to be M.I.A.,” she said. “In the big picture, I see it as something that opened the door for me to get away. All I’d ever done was act.” Ms. Ryder retreated to San Francisco, where she was raised and owns a house, to be near her parents and a vast community of friends. She has been in a long-term relationship with Scott Mackinlay Hahn, a founder of the fashion label Loomstate. In conversation, she’s something of a meanderer, often switching topics midthought or not finishing her sentences. But in reflecting on the aftershocks of the scandal, Ms. Ryder stayed on course. “Look,” she said, “I think I’ll forever be associated with that. Definitely.” But, she added, “In the grand scheme of things it wasn’t exactly the crime of the century.” She also pointed out that her career doldrums coincided with her entering her 30s, a sell-by date for many actresses in Hollywood. “I went from weirdo teenager to pixie waif to them not knowing what the hell to do with me,” Ms. Ryder said, adding that it wasn’t until 2010, when Darren Aronofsky cast her as a washed-up prima ballerina in “Black Swan,” that things clicked back into place. “I felt like for the first time in a long time people really responded to me,” she explained. “That was a very liberating thing, because I was playing my age. In my mind, and I think in a lot of people’s minds, that really helped. I sort of graduated.” Last year, however, when she was cast as the tough-talking Yonkers council member Vincenza Restiano, in the politically charged TV mini-series, “Show Me a Hero,” creator David Simon repeatedly cautioned her to leave entrenched mannerisms at home. “He said it, like, three times: ‘Don’t show us the Winona eyes,’” said Ms. Ryder. “After I wrapped, he said something to me to the effect of ‘We really showed them.’ And it actually hadn’t occurred to me that he’d actually had to fight for me, that HBO was hesitant, that I just wasn’t the obvious choice for the role.” If there is a consensus among her friends and colleagues, though, it’s that the slow pace of Ms. Ryder’s return might also have something to do with her attitude toward show business. “She’s not like some actors who crave and need the spotlight — Winona’s life is full and broad,” said Shawn Levy, who produced “Stranger Things.” As Daniel Waters, a longtime friend who wrote the screenplay for “Heathers,” said: “She’s not going to put up a periscope and go looking for work — she just waits until it washes up on the beach. I think of her as the last connection to old Hollywood. She has all that glamour that’s lost today, that’s been pummeled by Instagram and TMZ. She inspires a kind of cultist love that I don’t see other ingénues inspiring. Audrey Hepburn used to send her clothes. ” Ms. Ryder has also rediscovered parts of fame she may not have missed. Recently, a reporter for Time magazine asked her to comment on allegations that Mr. Depp abused his wife, Amber Heard. (In a court filing, Mr. Depp’s lawyer said Ms. Heard was “attempting to secure a premature financial resolution by alleging abuse.”) “The whole thing is so weird,” Ms. Ryder said. “I was 17 — that’s almost a quarter-century ago. But I gave an honest answer.” Her response — that Mr. Depp was “never abusive” to her — was taken by some as coming to his defense. “Maybe it was naïve of me to not realize it was going to feed the monster. But I’m not going to backpedal on it. You can’t win. If I’d said, ‘No comment,’ it would have been, ‘Ryder is silent,’” she boomed in a deep, suspicious voice. “‘What’s she hiding?’” These days, though, with her new series, talk of a “Beetlejuice” sequel and her appearance in the spring as the new face of Marc Jacobs’s cosmetic line, there’s a sense that she’s back on track, if the careers of classic Hollywood stars are any indication. “I love watching old movies, and I read a lot of autobiographies,” Ms. Ryder said. “Apparently Bette Davis and a lot of actresses had a hard time in their 30s, too.”","los angeles episode netflix supernatural drama stranger single mother played winona ryder sits cubby hole communicating son tangled ball blinking christmas lights vanished mysterious circumstances understand sell strange emotional moment ms ryder looked mother cynthia palmer don kids mom helped lot ms ryder sitting leather couch hollywood roosevelt hotel dressed black jeans faded leonard cohen shirt bought concert call mom indication child dead lights telling isn honey totally primal pint size ms ryder storms stranger streaming july generating matt ross duffer twins created series essential winona ness air fragility feisty determination intense energy winona wiry unpredictability sort anxiousness lean matt duffer inspired brothers incorporate ms ryder traits late s s ms ryder godfather lsd enthusiast timothy leary sort emblem cool dating johnny depp soul asylum frontman dave pirner inspiring s punk band call wynona riders duffers online reaction trailer stranger set s revealed deep nostalgia ms ryder winona forever fans lot matt duffer icon hasn forgotten rattled ms ryder hits including tim burton films beetlejuice edward scissorhands grew movies hoping desperately onscreen people feel youthful ms ryder isn mother played abrams star trek reboot cameo spock mom stranger offer leading role nuance dimension lot scripts mom ms ryder demonstrating ancillarity roles putting hands hips tilting head announcing sternly mon kids heyday difficult imagine ms ryder time oscar nominee weigh flimsy options feature film debut lucas starring role dark comedy heathers popular girl decides radically upend school pecking kicked winning streak decade indie gems jim jarmusch night earth woody allen celebrity martin scorsese th century period drama age innocence ms ryder arrested shoplifting convicted taking estimated $ worth designer saks avenue beverly hills calif possession pharmaceutical drugs including demerol vicodin percodan sentenced probation drug counseling hours community service continued ms ryder disappeared spotlight humiliating store surveillance footage watched clip youtube feeling ms ryder discovered silver lining personally soul stuff picture door act ms ryder retreated san francisco raised owns house parents vast community friends term relationship scott mackinlay hahn founder fashion label loomstate conversation meanderer switching topics midthought finishing sentences reflecting aftershocks scandal ms ryder stayed ll forever added grand scheme wasn crime century career doldrums coincided entering s sell date actresses hollywood weirdo teenager pixie waif knowing hell ms ryder adding wasn darren aronofsky cast washed prima ballerina black swan clicked time time people responded explained liberating playing age mind lot people minds helped sort graduated cast tough talking yonkers council vincenza restiano politically charged tv mini series hero creator david simon repeatedly cautioned leave entrenched mannerisms home times don winona eyes ms ryder wrapped effect hadn occurred fight hbo hesitant wasn obvious choice role consensus friends colleagues slow pace ms ryder return attitude business actors crave spotlight winona life broad shawn levy produced stranger daniel waters longtime friend wrote screenplay heathers periscope waits washes beach connection hollywood glamour lost pummeled instagram tmz inspires cultist love don ingénues inspiring audrey hepburn send clothes ms ryder rediscovered fame missed recently reporter time magazine comment allegations depp abused wife amber heard court filing depp lawyer ms heard attempting secure premature financial resolution alleging abuse weird ms ryder quarter century ago honest answer response depp abusive coming defense naïve realize feed monster backpedal win comment ryder silent boomed deep suspicious voice hiding days series talk beetlejuice sequel appearance spring marc jacobs cosmetic line sense track careers classic hollywood stars indication love watching movies read lot autobiographies ms ryder apparently bette davis lot actresses hard time s"
